Hello everybody, it's John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, sourdough baguette. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Sourdough baguette is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It's appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. Sourdough baguette is something which I have loved my whole life. They are nice and they look wonderful.

Crisp and light, with a crackly brown crust, these baguettes are super-easy to make. I baked these in two batches of three in my home oven. When baking the first three, the remaining three were rested in the fridge.

To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can cook sourdough baguette using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.
