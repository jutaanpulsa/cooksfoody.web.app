- "If you cook the ham before making it into a ribbon: It looks a bit stiff, but I could form it into a ribbon! The entire slice of ham cooked evenly."
- "If you form the ribbon before cooking it: only a portion of the ham&#39;s surface will cook . If you use this method be sure to secure the ribbon with a toothpick!"
- "I put the two versions side by side so you can see the difference. Left (1 ribbon) - cooked first; right (2 ribbons) - cooked after forming."
- "In Step 12, if you cook the ham before forming the ribbon, cool it down a bit before handling it. Just for reference."
