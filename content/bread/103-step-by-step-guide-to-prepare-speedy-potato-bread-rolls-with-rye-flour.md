- "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 230°C/450°F. Place a shallow oven-safe pan at the bottom of the oven while preheating - you&#39;ll use this to create steam later! (You can skip the steam if necessary, though the crust won&#39;t come out as good)."
- "Right before baking, bring some water to a boil on the stove (for the steam). When ready to put in the bread, cut a 1 cm slit into each dough ball. Pour the boiling water into the pan at the bottom of the stove (be careful of the steam!). Put in the bread in the middle rack."
- "Total bake time will be 20 minutes: Bake for 10 minutes at 230°C/450°F, then remove the steam pan. Lower the heat to 200°C/400°F and bake for another 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool uncovered on a wire rack."
