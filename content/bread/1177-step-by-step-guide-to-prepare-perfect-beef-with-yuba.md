recipeingredient:
- "1 lb beef flap"
- "5 oz. yuba"
- "1/2 cup soy sauce"
- "1/2 tsp grated fresh ginger"
- "1/2 tsp grated fresh garlic"
- "1/8 tsp five spice"
- "1 tbsp banana ketchup"
- "2 tbsp mirin"
- "1 tbsp sesame oil"
- "1 tbsp sesame seeds"
- "1 bunch chives"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the beef flap against the grain into thin strips"
- "Carefully unfold your sheets of yuba, then roll them up and slice in wide, fettuccine-like strands. Yuba can be difficult to find. If there&#39;s a tofu maker in your area, they will have yuba as a tofu making byproduct. In the SF Bay Area, the main source is Hodo Soy. Their products are available at some local farmers markets, and occasionally at some local Whole Foods locations."
- "Combine soy with grated ginger and garlic, as well as mirin, banana ketchup and 5 spice. Pour it over the beef and set it aside to marinate. Swap regular ketchup for banana ketchup if you like. Basically, I just sweetened the soy sauce, so you should feel free to experiment here."
- "Heat sesame oil in a nonstick pan. It should be just about to start smoking. Toss in the yuba strips. Keep them moving because yuba can stick like crazy. I like to use chopsticks to stir and separate the strands as I Sautée this stuff."
- "When your yuba starts to look a little like the skin of a potsticker, toss in the beef strips. Stir it up."
- "Toss in the sesame seeds. Mix it all up. When the beef is cooked through, dice up the chives and add them over the top."
