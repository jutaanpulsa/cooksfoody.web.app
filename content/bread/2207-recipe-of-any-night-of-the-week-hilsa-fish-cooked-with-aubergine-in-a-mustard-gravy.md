recipeingredient:
- "As required Hilsa fish except the head and the tail pieces"
- "2-3 Aubergine preferably the long and thin ones"
- "2 tablespoon mustard seed paste"
- "As required Mustard oil to shallow fry the fish and cook the gravy"
- "1 teaspoon turmeric"
- "To taste Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and keep the ilish fish mixed with turmeric and salt."
- "Take a pan or wok and add some mustard oil.   Once the oil heats up, fry the ilish. Now this fish doesn&#39;t need to be fried at all. You can use it raw in the gravy and it gets cooked. Also tastes better when used raw in the dishes. However I had very very lightly fried both sides for not even a minute to give a little colour to it."
- "Prepare a paste of mustard seeds with green chilli."
- "Use the same oil that was used to shallow fry the fishes. Cut few aubergine in long cylinder shapes and sautee them until they turn soft. You may sprinkle a little salt. Once done, keep them aside."
- "In the same oil, add few nigella seeds and slit green chilli,sautee for a minute and add water with some turmeric."
- "Now add the fried aubergine. Bring the curry to a boil. Add the mustard paste and give a stir. Adjust the seasoning and the consistency of the curry. Finally add the fried ilish and allow it to cook on flame for some 5minutes.Do not cook the gravy for a longer time once the mustard paste is added. We want to retain the hotness of the mustard in the gravy. The curry here is very mild and the gravy is a little of watery consistency. The fish adds a nice aroma and taste to it."
