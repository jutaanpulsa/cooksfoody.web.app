- "1 up to 14 cup  Sugar cane sugar or sugar of your choice "
- "237 ml Water "
- "1 tbsp Kinako"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a rectangular heat-resistant pan, combine all ☆ ingredients, and mix. Cover with a lid at 90 degrees but keep it open a crack (or wrap in plastic wrap)."
- "Microwave for a minute, remove, mix with a fork, then return it to the microwave. Be careful not to burn yourself. Repeat the process until it becomes transparent and reaches a jelly-like consistency."
- "Cool in a large pan filled with water. Once cool, close the lid and chill in the refrigerator for at least an hour."
- "The transparent mixture will turn cloudy. Any small bubbles that may have formed should also disappear."
- "Sprinkle kinako on top, cut in the center cross-wise with a spatula or knife, then agitate the pan to loosen the contents."
- "Cut the two sections into half again so that contents are sectioned into quarters. Sprinkling kinako along the cuts will free the edges and keep them from sticking."
- "Quarter the sections lengthwise to make 16 rectangular pieces."
- "Use a spatula to cut around the pan edge to free the cakes from the pan completely. Cover with a lid and shake vigorously. Sprinkle evenly with kinako, then it&#39;s ready to serve!"

- "You can leave out the sugar if you wish."
