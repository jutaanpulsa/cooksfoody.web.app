recipeingredient:
- " For the dough"
- "100 grams Dango flour"
- "65 grams Sugar"
- "130 ml Lukewarm water"
- " For the coating"
- "30 grams Kinako"
- "5 grams Cinnamon"
- " For the filling"
- "1 Anko sweet bean paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "These are the only ingredients you need to prepare!"
- "Start by mixing the ○ ingredients. Then mix the ◎ ingredients. Mixing them first will prevent lumps!"
- "Add lukewarm water to the ○ ingredients and mix well. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes (for a 500 watt microwave). Then mix gently and microwave for 3 more minutes."
- "If you&#39;re using a 600 watt microwave, cook for 2 minutes, mix, and return to the microwave for 1 minute and 40 seconds. The picture shows the mixture after microwaving the first time and then mixing."
- "When it&#39;s translucent like the picture, it&#39;s done.  If it needs a little longer, microwave for 10 second intervals and watch carefully!"
- "Take a large piece of plastic wrap and put some of the ◎ mixture. Then place the dough on top and sprinkle on the rest of the ◎ mixture."
- "Roll out into a thin dough. Try to roll it flat into a square, so you won&#39;t waste dough. (But somehow I always end up making a rectangle..)"
- "Cut into squares. Rectangles are okay too. I recommend using a pizza cutter for this step!"
- "Cut off a corner of the bag of anko (sweet bean paste) and squeeze out anko. If you make a pretty large incision in the bag, the anko will come out like in the picture, and the yatsuhashi will look nice when you fold it."
- "If the dough pieces were too long when you cut them, you can stretch with your hands to make them more square."
- "You can get all the ingredients at a supermarket, so it only costs about 100 yen to make this recipe."
