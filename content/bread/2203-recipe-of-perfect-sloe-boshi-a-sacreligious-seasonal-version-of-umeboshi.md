- "Gather up your ingredients. You&#39;ll need 10% of the weight of your sloes in salt. You&#39;ll also need a jar to ferment them in, and a sandwich bag to act as a weight."
- "Rinse your sloes"
- "Mix the sloes and salt"
- "Pack them into the jar, then add the sandwich bag on top. Fill it a bit with water to act as a weight."

The sloes will ferment in the brine, and after 10 days should be done. Give one a try. Once they&#39;re done, drain of the liquid (keep it), and dehydrate the sloes. I&#39;ll add steps once I have got this far!"
