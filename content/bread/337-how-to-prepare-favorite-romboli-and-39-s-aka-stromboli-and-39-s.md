recipeingredient:
- "2 loaves frozen bread dough or you can use homemade"
- "1 lb honey ham thinly sliced"
- "5 oz shredded gouda cheede"
- "5 oz shredded white cheddar"
- "1 packages sliced pepperoni add as much or as little as u like here"
- "1 some butter to use for the tops"
recipeinstructions:
- "If using frozen bread dough I like to let mine rise for a few hours covered on the counter."
- "Preheat oven to 375°F. Cut loaves of dough into 4 equal parts and set aside. At this time I like to set up an assembly line of my meats and cheeses."
- "Grease a baking sheet with butter flavor spray, set aside. Take a piece of dough and press it out into a circle, it will be about 5 inches or so once pressed. Make sure u don&#39;t have any holes as the cheese will leak thru. Lay 3-4 slices of ham, then about 8 slices of pepperoni or what u prefer, top with a good grab of cheese and fold up carefully. Lay onto greased baking sheet and repeat til all are finished. You may need two baking sheets cuz u don&#39;t want them real close together."
- "Bake for about 20 min or so. I honestly can&#39;t say an exact time cuz I just watch them til they brown. Pull from oven and brush tops with butter. That&#39;s it! Yummy gooeyness!!!"
- "You can use any cheeses or toppings you like, this is what we prefer. The gouda cheese is simply amazing in these!! Absolutely my favorite!!"
