The first time I tasted chocolate sable cookies, I wasn&#39;t actually in France, but in Miette&#39;s Bakery in San Francisco. If ever you are in Paris, you must make a pilgrimage to the Pierre Hermé boutique on rue Bonaparte. I made such a pilgrimage during a trip to Paris the first year I was in business, joining the queue that wraps around the block. Sable in French means &#34;sandy&#34; — these are a classic French cookie, made out of crumbly chocolate shortbread.
