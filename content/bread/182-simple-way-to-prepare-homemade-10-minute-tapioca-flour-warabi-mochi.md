recipeingredient:
- "70 grams Tapioca flour"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "150 ml Water"
- "1 for cooling down the dough Ice water"
- " Toppings"
- "1 Kinako"
- "1 Brown sugar or brown sugar syrup"
- "1 you may also substitute with jam coconut milk etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the water, sugar, and tapioca (the ○ ingredients) in a pot. Completely dissolve the tapioca and break down any lumps before turning on the heat."
- "Set the stove to medium heat. With a wooden spatula, slowly mix all the ingredients together, being sure to scrape the bottom of the pot. Once the water becomes warm, set the heat to low and do not allow the mixture to come to a boil. Continuously stir the mixture, as the tapioca will gradually thicken, developing a glue-like consistency."
- "Knead the paste well with the spatula and be careful not to let it burn by either lowering the heat or periodically removing the pot from the stove. Keep kneading for about 5 minutes until the mixture changes from a milky white colour into a translucent dough. When this becomes translucent and develops an elastic consistency, it will become quite firm and difficult to mix."
- "Gather the dough together in the pot to form a ball. Once it has become translucent, transfer the ball of dough directly into the ice water. Flattening the dough in the ice water will allow the center of the dough to cool more quickly."
- "Tear off bite-sized pieces of dough and gently form into balls.The center of the balls will be hot, so be careful not to burn yourself. Squeezing the dough between the base of your thumb and index finger, rather than using your fingertips, will allow you to cleanly tear off balls of dough. Drop into ice water and allow to fully cool."
- "Gently drain the dough in a strainer, and finish by topping with a mixture of the kinako and brown sugar. This can even work well by using brown sugar syrup or a watered down version of your favourite jam, and will give it a Western-Japanese touch. Adding coconut milk will give it a tropical flair."
- "If you are having difficulty cleanly tearing the dough, you can use a knife. If you are planning on making a large amount, it is better to make many small batches rather than making one large batch."
