- "Cook the rice. If you don&#39;t have a rice cooker, you can use a normal pot and an oven or a microwave. If you use a pot, put a lid and heat it until boiling. Then lower the heat and cook for about 15 minutes. Stop heating and leave it for 10 minutes with the lid on.  In case of microwave, put in a microwavable bowl and cover with plastic wrap.
