- "1 Ham green peas etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the tofu as-is (without draining the tofu) in a bowl, and mash finely with your fingers."
- "Add the pancake mix to the bowl from Step 1 (you don&#39;t even need to sift it in!), add the ham cut into 7 mm dices, green peas, or your favorite toppings, and mix well with your hands. You could also add raisins or other sweet toppings if you&#39;d like."
- "Line 4 small microwave-safe containers (such as pudding cups or muffin cups) with parchment paper cut into squares. Once the batter is thoroughly combined, pour it into each container up to 80%."
- "Place them on the turn-table of your microwave, loosely cover all 4 containers with plastic wrap, and microwave for about 4 minutes. Microwaving times will differ according to your machine, so start checking them after 3 minutes and adjust. They&#39;ll be done as soon as the microwave goes &#34;beep&#34;!"
- "Add about 2 teaspoons of combined white miso and country-style miso to the batter, and it will turn out to be a delicious slightly miso-flavored steamed bread! If adding the miso, I recommend also adding raisins to the batter."
