recipeingredient:
- "1 dozen eggs"
- "2 tbsp capers"
- " Juice of 1 lemon"
- "1 tbsp fresh ground pepper"
- "1 tsp salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get a steamer goin strong. Make sure it&#39;s big enough to accommodate all of your eggs."
- "When you&#39;ve got plenty of steam going, arrange your eggs inside and set a timer for 10 minutes."
- "Get a bow of ice water ready."
- "At the 10 minute alarm, move your eggs to the ice water. You can clean up your steamer and put it away while you&#39;re waiting for the eggs to cool."
- "Add about 1/2 inch of water to a large mason jar. When your eggs are cool, place them, 2-3 at a time in the jar, cap it off, and shake it gently to crush the shells. Work through your whole batch of eggs."
- "Now carefully peel and rinse your eggs. This is always a craps shoot. There are a million tricks out there for making perfect, easy-to-peel hard boiled eggs. Some of them work... Some of the time... I think it&#39;s mostly got to do with luck and care. I do think steaming helps, and shocking them in ice water, but no guarantee."
- "Now you&#39;ve got the 12 perfectly cooked, perfectly peeled hard boiled eggs, right? Slice each in half lengthwise and pop the yolks out into a bowl."
- "Add the remaining ingredients to the yolks and mix with a fork. You just want to break up the yolks and disperse the ingredients evenly. The mix should stay kinda chunky."
- "Make any seasoning adjustments you need, then spoon a bit of this mix into each egg white. Add a little sprinkle of smoked paprika and send &#39;em out."
