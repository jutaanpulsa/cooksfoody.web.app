recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the chicken diagonally into 1 cm wide pieces. Season with the ★ ingredients, place in the pot, add the ◎ ingredients and let the flavors blend together for 10 minutes. Turn on the heat to medium and once the chicken has cooked and plumped up, add the water."
- "Once the water begins to boil, remove the scum from the surface, add the ● and stir. Turn off the heat."

- "Thinly slice the root vegetables vertically using a peeler. Cut the core of the Chinese cabbage into matchstick sized strips. Any vegetables that don&#39;t cook quickly should be cut this way. Place the vegetables that you have chosen to use into the prepared hotpot soup from Step 3."
