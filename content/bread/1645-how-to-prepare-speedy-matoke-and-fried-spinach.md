I also drained the spinach after cooking as another reviewer suggested and sprinkled the spinach liberally with salt right after adding it. In addition to ugali, Kenyans rely on potatoes, rice, chapati and matoke. The rice-based dishes, biryani and pilau, are clearly derived from Persia - they should be delicately spiced with saffron and star anise, and liberally sprinkled with carrot and raisins. The chapati is identical to its Indian predecessor, while.
