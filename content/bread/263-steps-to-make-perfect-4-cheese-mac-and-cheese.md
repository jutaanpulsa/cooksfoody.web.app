I made this with shell noodles, but I did not have box Mac&#39;n&#39;cheese so I just add more cheese and milk and it tasted so good and it was really cheesy and delicious. This is absolutely my FAVORITE mac &amp; cheese recipe. I&#39;ve given it to countless friends &amp; family members and all of them have fallen in love with it as well.
