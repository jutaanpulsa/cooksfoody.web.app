recipeinstructions:
- "Do strawberry reduction: Puree about the double the amount of required reduced strawberries or about 1 1/2 cup strawberries. Once pureed, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until it has reduced to the required 1 1/4 cup overall requirement, or until it thickens and becomes deep red in colour.

- "Make the batter. Sift and mix together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Set aside."
- "Combine the all purpose cream, vinegar, and salt until lumpy. Set aside."
- "Cream together the softened butter and sugar. Beat in the egg whites to high speed. Mix in the lumpy cream mixture and add in the vanilla extract."
- "Pour in the creamy mixture slowly onto the dry ingredients and mix at low speed until well combined."
- "Pour in the milk just until combined."
- "Fold in the 1/2 cup reduced strawberry. You may add in 2 drops or less of flavor and coloring but are optional."
- "Grease and flour the pan or line the pan with aluminum foil, to avoid sticking. There are also non-sticking cooking sprays available which you may use."
- "Pour in the batter into the pan and bake in the oven for 60-70minutes or until the stick comes out clean when you poke it all the way into the cake."
- "For the filling/frosting, mix the cream, sugar and vanilla at high speed until medium peaks. Fold in the remaining reduced strawberry. You may opt to put flavor and coloring. You will use this mixture for both filling and frosting."
- "Once the cake is baked, let it cool completely. Remove the ‘cake top’ or the curved top of the cake to make it flat. Set aside the removed cake top."
- "Slice the cake into two layers."
- "Put some filling in the first layer and spread out the semi-mashed strawberries. Sandwich the filling with the second layer and cover the whole cake with the remaining frosting."
- "Crumb the cake top and use it as toppings to the frosted cake. You may also put some whole strawberries."
- "Chill, serve and enjoy!"
