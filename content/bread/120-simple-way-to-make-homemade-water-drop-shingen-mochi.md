recipeinstructions:
- "This is the original Shingen mochi from the store Kinseiken in Yamanashi Prefecture."
- "This agar powder is manufactured from algae. It can form clumps, so dissolve it by gradually adding water to it."
- "Heat the dissolved mixture over high. Once it comes to a boil, turn down the heat to low and continue heating for another 2 minutes while stirring from time to time. Then move the pot to an ice water bath to cool down, for about 3 minutes."
- "Prepare an ice tray that produces spherical ice. The one I use is from Muji and made with silicone."
- "Once your ice tray is ready, pour in the mochi liquid with a funnel."
- "It looks best once plated (on the bamboo leaf) if you pour the mixture just up to the 60% to 70% mark. Chill in the refrigerator for an hour or so, and it&#39;s done."
