- "Add the sugar and salt and continue to cook under low heat until the onions turn a golden to dark brown. You may add the mushrooms and saute slightly at this point.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Be patient if the caramelizing of the onion slices take a while. You do not want high heat and risk burning your onions. :)"

- "While the soup is simmering, slice your pan de sal (or bread of choice) horizontally into 1/4-inch thick slices. This will be your soup&#39;s &#34;topping&#34;."
- "Turn off the heat once soup is cooked down to desired flavor."
- "To serve, crack a whole egg into your soup bowl and pour your hot soup over it. Top with your bread slices."
