recipeinstructions:
- "Set all of the ingredients into the bread maker aside from the kuromame and anko, then start it on the dough course..."
- "Release the gas, and roll it up into one ball. I used black beans and kinako soy flour this time, so the dough is speckled black."

- "Spread out the red bean paste, and pack in the kuromame and chestnuts (cut about the same size as the beans)."
- "Roll it up tightly using both hands. Roll it around to adjust the thickness."
- "Cut it according to the size of the cake pan. I&#39;m using a small cake pan this time, so I cut it into 10 equal portions."
- "This will turn out nicely after proofing, even if there are gaps between them. Line them up so that the overlap is on the inside. Place the leftovers into an aluminum cup."
- "Let rise in the oven using your oven&#39;s proofing function (at 40-45°C for 35 minutes. Brush it with the egg glaze after that, and bake in an oven preheated to 180°C for 25 minutes."
- "It&#39;s good if you use a bitt of the leftover chestnuts and beans as a topping."
- "Please eat right after baking while it&#39;s still sweet smelling and piping hot Take it out after about 12 minutes if you baked this smaller in aluminum cups!"
- "This is a version made with just anko and chestnuts!!"
