- "Put the baking tray in a preheated 170°C oven, and bake for 10 minutes. Take the tray out."
- "Press down hard with a spoon to make the cookies about 3 mm thick. (If they become funny shapes, no worries, that&#39;s the charm of homemade cookies. Just keep going.)"

- "Take the cookies out of the oven as soon as they are baked, and cool on a rack."
- "If it&#39;s too much work for you to form the dough into balls in Step 6, or if you want cookies that look rough and wild, you can just rip the dough and bake the unformed ripped pieces. Cookies made this way may look cuter."
