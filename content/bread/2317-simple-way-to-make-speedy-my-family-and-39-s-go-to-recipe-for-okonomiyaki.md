recipeingredient:
- "1/2 of a medium head  Cabbage chopped"
- "200 grams Pork belly slices cut into bite sizes"
- " Batter Its a very thick sticky batter"
- "6 tbsp Cake flour"
- "4 tbsp Nagaimo also called mountain yam grated into pulp"
- "4 tbsp Dashi stock or water  dashi stock granules"
- "2 Eggs"
- "2 tbsp Tempura crumbs"
- "1 Okonomiyaki sauce"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 Aonori"
- "1 Bonito flakes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the batter ingredients marked with a ●. Mix just the flour and dashi stock first, and then it&#39;ll be easier to add other ingredients. Sakura shrimp and squid (not listed) make good additions to the batter too."
- "Toss about one and a half handfuls of the cabbage and a ladle full of the batter into a bowl, and mix well. Pour the mixture onto a pre-heated electric griddle, and spread it evenly into a thick circle."
- "The batter will not flow out around the mound of cabbage. You might be worried that there isn&#39;t enough batter, but it&#39;s fine. The only concern here would be whether there&#39;s enough cabbage."
- "Top this with as much sliced pork belly as you like. Use thin slices and line them up so that there&#39;s no space in between! Or, at least that&#39;s how my family likes it."
- "When the bottom has browned, flip the patty over. Make absolutely sure not to press or smash the patty! You&#39;ll have to be content with just adjusting the shape a little."
- "After a bit, it&#39;s easier to use 2 spatulas to flip the patty over again."
- "Brush the top with your preferred okonomiyaki sauce, top with aonori and katsuobushi (bonito flakes), and enjoy."
- "This time, the okonomiyaki was cooked by my husband, who usually doesn&#39;t cook it. The shape came out poorly, but see! Even an amateur was able to make this. It didn&#39;t fall apart."
