recipeingredient:
- "500 g flour"
- "250 ml water"
- "25 g sourdough starter"
- "5 g salt roughly 1tsp"
- "50 g sunflowercoconutcanola oil"
- "50 g agave syrup or honey"
- "80 g aquafabachickpea water"
recipeinstructions:
- "The night before, start the dough. Dissolve starter in water then add flour. Knead a bit. Add salt. The dough will be quite dry. (It&#39;s going to get wetter tomorrow when you add the other ingredients). Rub dough with oil, wrap in clingfilm and leave overnight at room temperature."
- "In the morning, add the chickpea juice, the honey and the oil. If this makes the dough too wet, add a bit more flour. You are aiming for the dough to be *slightly* wet/sticky. Cover with the clingfilm and leave to prove for 4 hours (but do a round of folds every hour)"
- "Cut the dough into 6 equal portions (or 5, 4, 3 etc). You&#39;ll probably want to use scales to weigh make sure the portions are the same weight. Form each portion into a ball, cover and leave to rest for 20mins."
- "Roll each of the balls into a sausage shape. Braid the sausages together. Me describing the process here will not help you - search for challah braiding videos on YouTube. Put the braided loaf on a baking tray and cover with clingfilm. Prove for 3 hours at room temperature or until it has doubled in size."
- "Heat oven to 180C with a tray of water in the bottom. Brush outside of challah with chickpea water. Sprinkle with seeds if desired. Bake for 45 mins (my dough weighed 1030g)."
