recipeingredient:
- "2 Onions"
- "1/2 stick Butter"
- "1 tbsp EVOO"
- "1 6 Slices of Bacon"
- "1 cup Smoked Gouda"
- "2 cup Gruyere"
- "1 cup Sharp Cheddar"
- "1/2 cup Parmesan Ramano or pecorino"
- "3 tbsp butter"
- "3 tbsp Flour"
- "4 cup Warm Milk"
- "2 oz 14 1 Penne Pasta Cooked Al Dente"
recipeinstructions:
- "First caramelize your onions. Halve or quarter your onions and cut into thin slices. Melt 1/2 stick butter and olive oil in a medium size, high sided skillet over medium high heat. Add onions, cook 5 minutes until slightly translucent, add salt and pepper (a pinch of cayenne for a kick) then reduce heat to very low. Cook for at least an hour, stirring occasionally, until onions are a gorgeous deep amber color. Remove onions from skillet and set aside."
- "Fry your bacon to your preference in the same skillet. Remove and place on paper towel to cool. Once it&#39;s cooled chop or tear into bite sized pieces."
- "To this very same skillet (imagine all that good bacon, caramelized onion flavor in there!) over medium/low heat, add 3 Tablespoons of butter and melt. Once butter has melted add the flour and cook together for at least one minute, you want to cook off the flour a bit so your sauce doesn&#39;t taste of it. Slowly whisk in your milk, I do about a cup at a time. Be sure to whisk well. After each addition let this mixture bubble and thicken (can take up to 5-10 minutes as you near the end). If need be add a bit more milk, you don&#39;t want this sauce to be oh-so thick because you&#39;ll be adding a lot of cheese which will naturally thicken it up."
- "Once you&#39;ve got a slightly thick, silky sauce, remove skillet from heat and whisk in cheeses, a few cups at a time, until fully incorporated and smooth."
- "With a wooden spoon, fold in your cooked pasta, then onions, and finally cooked bacon."
