recipeingredient:
- "3 cm Daikon radish"
- "2 tbsp Kinako"
- "1 to 2 tablespoons Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the daikon (raw) into 5 - 6 mm cubes and add to a bowl. Add the soybean flour and sugar, and without using utensils, mix together as if sifting to coat."
- "Caution: If you add the soybean flour first then the sugar, it won&#39;t coat, so be sure to do both at the same time."
- "Please use the center of the daikon. This should reduce the daikon flavor."
- "But if you cut from the ends, and you feel it&#39;s spicy, then add a shake of cinnamon (plus a lot of sugar)."
- "After a while, moisture will come out and it&#39;ll turn into a paste. Then add more soybean flour if you like. Don&#39;t add sugar, just the soybean flour, and it&#39;ll be delicious."
- "If it becomes watery, just keep adding flour and repeat. The 5 mm corners will eventually turn into 1 cm corners?! You&#39;ll have large pieces as well. But this will multiply the deliciousness."
