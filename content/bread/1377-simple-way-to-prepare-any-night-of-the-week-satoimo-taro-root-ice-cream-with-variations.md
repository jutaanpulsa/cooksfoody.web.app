recipeingredient:
- " Base"
- "250 grams unpeeled 200 grams peeled Satoimo taro"
- "200 ml Milk or homegenized soy milk"
- "70 to 100 grams Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 Vanilla extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the unpeeled satoimo well. Wrap in plastic and microwave. When a bamboo skewer goes through easily, remove the peel with your hands. 250 g of satoimo unpeeled is about 200 g peeled."
- "Put the satoimo, milk, sugar, salt and vanilla essence in a food processor, and process until smooth. Do this while the satoimo is still warm. It should have a thick consistency that won&#39;t drop from a spoon at this point."
- "Transfer to a container and freeze. It will freeze in 2 to 4 hours."
- "If you have the energy, pierce it several times with a fork just before it freezes solid to open many holes. This is to defrost it easier when it&#39;s time to eat it."
- "When you want to eat this, defrost using the microwave&#39;s defrost function to soften it (or leave it out at room temperature)and mix well until it&#39;s your desired consistency."
- "Cheese flavor: This is the version in the top photo. Add 100 g of cream cheese, 1 teaspoon rum, and 1/2 to 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to the base."
- "Black sesame flavor: Add 1 tablespoon of black sesame seeds and 1 tablespoon of ground black sesame seeds to the base."
- "Chocolate flavor: Add 40 g of bar chocolate and 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder. Warm up the milk in the base beforehand. Break up the chocolate bar and add to the food processor."
- ""
- "Coffee and banana flavor: For coffee flavor, add 1 tablespoon of instant coffee to the base (it will be quite strong). For banana, add 100 g of banana and 1 tablespoon of banana liqueur to the base."
- "Matcha and condensed milk flavor: To add matcha tea flavor, add 1 1/2 tablespoons to the base. For condensed milk flavor, use 3 tablespoons of sugar in the base and add 3 to 4 tablespoons of condensed milk."
- ""
- "Zunda flavor: Add 50 g of shelled edamame (100 g before shelling)."
- "Raspberry flavor: Add 50 g of raspberries to the base. I made the sauce by processing raspberries and condensed milk together."
