recipeinstructions:
- "Grease your cookie cutter lightly with shortening and stick on a sheet of parchment paper."
- "Combine the milk and butter and microwave to warm. Microwave for 1 minute at 600 W if they&#39;re just out of the fridge. Let the residual heat dissolve the butter."

- "Whip the egg whites to make a meringue. Whip until stiff peaks form."
- "Whip the egg yolks until white and creamy."
- "Mix the melted butter and milk into the egg yolk and whip until it gets frothy."
- "Sift in the powder ingredients."
- "Using a whisk, mix lightly in cutting motion."
- "Add the meringue in 3 batches. Fold in lightly with a rubber spatula."
- "Keep on mixing to make the mixture fine and smooth, and break in large bubbles. When the batter becomes smooth, pour it into the hot mold."
- "Bake for 20 minutes at 180℃."
- "When done, take it out from the oven and drop from about a height of 20 cm to remove any trapped air."
- "Remove from the mold and serve while it&#39;s hot. Please enjoy the cake with whipped butter and maple syrup."
- "If you flip it over to serve, it&#39;s just like the pancakes served at posh cafes."
- "The insides are sooo fluffy, and really moist."
- "You can make 4 in 11 cm circular cookie cutters."
- "It goes really well with some runny fruit sauce. Also serve with ice cream."
- "You see here I&#39;ve served the cake with tons of cherry confiture."
- "Such an amazing cake to serve with fruit sauce."
- "Or, simply with berries and chocolate sauce..."
- "The shape stiffens a bit if you make it with 80 g cake flour."
- "And, if you make it with 100 g cake flour, it&#39;s really like those pancakes you see in cafes. Please make this cake to your liking."
