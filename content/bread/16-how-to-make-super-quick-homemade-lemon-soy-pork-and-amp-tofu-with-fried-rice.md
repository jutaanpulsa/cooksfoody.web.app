recipeinstructions:
- "In a pan, place (salted) pork belly with fat side down and add water, enough to cover 3/4 of it. Do this in medium heat and cover. This will help make the pork tender."
- "Flip on other side before water evaporates. Squeeze your lemon on the meat, both sides, cover. Once water has evaporated and you hear pan sizzling, place the 2t of oil to help render the fat and brown the meat. Turn on the other side when it has touches of brown."
- "Lower heat, add your garlic and onion. Add a drizzle of oil if needed to cook the onions/garlic. Quickly toss."
- "Add the cooked tofu, mix in your soy sauce, oyster sauce and salt &amp; pepper (to taste). Quickly toss. To prevent pork from over cooking to a hard rock, transfer to a plate as soon as you&#39;ve mixed in sauces."
- "On the same pan, without washing the drippings, add in your day old rice. Spread it around on the pan to let the rice absorb the remaining oils and soy sauces."
- "With a spatula, sauté rice until it has separated into individual pieces and color has changed from the pan drippings. Scrape off the rice sticking to the pan when mixing. That&#39;s delicious hehe. Serve with your pork &amp; tofu and enjoy!"
- "OPTIONAL TANGY SOY DIP: Mix equal parts of balsamic vinegar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and then add a little water. Adjust according to taste, if you want more tangy add more vinegar, if salty add more soy. Drop in chopped chilies and green onions or chopped red onions or even garlic."
