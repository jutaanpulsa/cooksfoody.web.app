- "Cut onion rougly. Rinse, deseed, I leave half of the seeds in, and cut Jalapeños, mince garlic, rougly chop bacon."
- "Pour ALL ingredients into crockpot, add enough water to cover beans (we like a lot of the juice so I make sure the beans have an  extra 1-2, 3-5 inches of water). Now turn on high 4-5 hrs or on low 6-8 hrs OR until beans are tender, still slightly firm, but not mushy.  I&#39;ve learned that every crock pot is a little different in cooking times."
