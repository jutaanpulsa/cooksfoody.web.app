recipeingredient:
- "250 g porridge oats"
- "75 g sultanas"
- "75 g unsalted butter"
- "75 g dark brown soft sugar"
- "50 g black treacle"
- "25 g golden syrup"
- "1-2 tablespoons rum flavouring to taste"
- " For the caramel"
- "1 (397 g) tin condensed milk"
- "80 g unsalted butter"
- "80 g golden caster sugar"
- " For the chocolate topping"
- "150 g dark chocolate melted"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat your oven to 170 C / Gas 3 to 4. Lightly grease either a 20cm round or square baking tin."
- "Starting with the flapjack, put the oats and sultanas in a large bowl and stir them together. In a saucepan add the butter, dark brown sugar, black treacle and golden syrup and, over a low heat, gently heat until all the ingredients are melted and the sugar has dissolved. Add the run flavouring in and stir it through. Remove from the heat and pour it over the oats and sultana mix and stir it through until well combined. Make sure the oats are completely covered with the syrupy mixture."
- "Tip the mixture into the prepared tin and press down into the tin using the back of a spoon. Pop it into the oven and bake until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and leave it in the tin. It’s worth just giving it a little press down with the back of a spoon again just to make sure it’s firm in the tin. Let it cool completely before doing anything else with it."
- "To make the caramel, tip the condensed milk, butter and golden caster sugar into a saucepan and put it on a medium/low heat on the hob. Bring to the boil stirring constantly to ensure that it doesn’t “catch.” This is really important; you don’t want it to catch – you get horrible brown/black bits in your caramel. When it gets to boiling point turn the hob down a bit so that the caramel is just simmering/bubbling gently. Still keep stirring the whole time for around 8 to 10 minutes."
- "Once the caramel is ready you need to act quickly. Remove from the heat and pour/spoon it over your flapjack and smooth it over the whole surface evenly. Do this as quickly as you can because the caramel will start to set quite swiftly. Let cool."
- "Finally, melt your chocolate, spread it over the caramel evenly and let it set. Loosen the flapjack from the tin (I use a knife and just run it around the edge) and then tip it out. Cut it up however you see fit."
- "Store in airtight container in the fridge for up to a week."

In a saucepan add the butter, dark brown sugar, black treacle and golden syrup and, over a low heat, gently heat until all the ingredients are melted and the sugar has dissolved. Add the run flavouring in and stir it through. Remove from the heat and pour it over the oats and sultana mix and stir it through until well combined.
