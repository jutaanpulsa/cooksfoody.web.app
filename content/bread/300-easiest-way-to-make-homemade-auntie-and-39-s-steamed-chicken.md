recipeingredient:
- "1 small whole chicken preferably free range and corn fed"
- "1.5 L vegetable or chicken stock"
- "3 medium carrots"
- "2 medium white onions"
- "3 cloves garlic"
- "A few cabbage leaves optional"
- "1 green or red pepper optional"
- "A few birds eye chillis"
- "1 glass good dry white wine"
- "to taste Salt and pepper"
- "Half a lemon peeled"
- " Oregano or majoram"
- "1 tablespoon olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "It&#39;s important in this method to keep the chicken off the base of the pot, so line the base with a generous collection of vegetables. We used sliced carrots, onions, garlic and peppers with a few cabbage leaves thrown in for good measure - but any vegetables you have to hand will do."
- "Stuff your chicken with half a peeled onion, half a lemon, a chilli (or two) and some garlic. Dry the outside of the chicken thoroughly and liberally season with salt."
- "Tuck the legs into the flaps of skin protruding from the rear to keep the bird neat and ensure it fits inside your pot. We used a cabbage leaf to help keep the smaller items secure inside."
- "Now you&#39;re ready to add stock, more seasoning and a glass of white wine. Start the chicken on &#34;Stew&#34; function, or medium heat if you&#39;re using a slow cooker."
- "Be sure to check liquid levels regularly, topping up with boiling water if they drop too low. Baste the chicken with the broth from time to time. After 90 minutes, carefully remove the chicken from the pot - beware, the bird&#39;s flesh will be so succulent it&#39;ll just fall off the bone so use tongs or a wide fish slice to pick up the chicken."
- "Serve with rice or roasted potatoes and vegetables."
- "Tip: once you&#39;re done you&#39;ll be left with the dense, delicious juices the chicken has been cooking in. This broth can be strained, chilled and used as stock for your next delicious meal."
