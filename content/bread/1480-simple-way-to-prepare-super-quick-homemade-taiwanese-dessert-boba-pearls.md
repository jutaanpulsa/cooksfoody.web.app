- "Round each small squares to small balls (be patient and do not require prefect roundness)."

Drain and mix with 2 tablespoons of brown sugar syrup or honey (or sugar) to avoid sticky together."
- "For the taro ball: steam the sweet potatoes until soft. Once it is cooked and warm, mash it and mix with sugar. Mix with tapioca flour (little by little)"
- "Transfer it to the floured surface and knead until it forms to a non-sticky dough."
