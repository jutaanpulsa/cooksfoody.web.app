recipeinstructions:
- "In a frying pan add the butter and mushrooms. Chop the chicken thighs to bite size chunks and add them to the pan. Add the thyme."
- "In a separate pan make the bechamel up. Don&#39;t forget to season it with black pepper and a dash of nutmeg. Stir in the chicken gravy granules. Pour in the chicken and mushrooms pan as well as the chopped gammon chunks and stir together."
- "If you need a really substantial pie filling you could add some diced carrot or some frozen peas to the pie filling to bulk it out."
