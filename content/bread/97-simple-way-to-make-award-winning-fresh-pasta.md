recipeingredient:
- "2 cups all purpose flour"
- "Pinch salt"
- "3 eggs"
- "1-3 tbsp ice water"
- " Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix flour and salt together in a food processor."
- "Mix in 3 eggs."
- "While mixing eggs into the flour mixture, pour in the ice water. Once it forms into a ball, stop and remove. (If your mixture doesn’t turn into a ball in the food processor and just stays as a powder, that’s okay. Makes sure it’s mixed well and dump it all out onto a clean workspace and knead it together by hand.)"
- "Knead the dough for 2-4 minutes on a lightly flour dusted work surface."
- "Once kneaded, form into a ball and cover the dough lightly with olive oil. Cover the dough and let it rest in room temperature for 30 minutes."
- "Once rested, divide the dough into 4 parts. Work one at a time. Keep the rest of the dough covered as to not get dry."
- "If using a stand mixer, lightly dust the dough in flour and pass it through the pasta maker whilst folding into threes and making sure your dough becomes a nice rectangular shape with nice edges. Gradually lower the number on the machine from 1 to 6 every time you pass it through."
- "If doing by hand, lightly dust the dough in flour and flatten it out with a rolling pin. You want to flatten it out until it reaches about 0.5-1.0 cm thickness. Fold the sheet in threes and continue flattening out until it reaches about 0.25cm thickness."
- "Cut into any size pasta you want, but for fettuccine, cut into 1.5cm wide noodles."
- "These noodles cook for 3 minutes in salted boiling water, or 2 minutes in salted boiling water and then 1 minute in sauce."
