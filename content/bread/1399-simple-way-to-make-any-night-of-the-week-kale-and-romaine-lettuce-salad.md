Hey everyone, I hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, kale and romaine lettuce salad. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

If the kale seems even the tiny bit wilted I&#39;d put it into a salad spinner with very cold water and let it crisp for a few minutes. Then spin the kale dry, dry more with paper towels if needed, and put kale into large salad bowl. Chop the romaine lettuce (discarding root ends and any damaged outer leaves). The kale is slivered super thin, and if you have time, it should sit in the citrusy dressing for a little while before meeting up with the romaine leaves.
