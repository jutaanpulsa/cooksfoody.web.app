recipeingredient:
- "2 pieces Mackerel fillets"
- "100 ml Water"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "50 ml Sake"
- "6 pieces Ginger thinly sliced"
- "2 Umeboshi"
- "1 tbsp Miso"
- "1 dash Salt"
- "1 Boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the mackerel into 3 pieces and sprinkle salt on both sides. Let it sit for 10 minutes. The salt will remove moisture from the fish, which helps reduce the fish smell."
- "Put the mackerel in a strainer and pour boiling water over it to remove the fish smell. This one extra step will make the mackerel really delicious."
- "To infuse the mackerel with a sweet flavor, add the water, sugar, sake, ginger, and umeboshi to a pot and bring to a simmer. Turn off the heat for a moment, arrange the mackerel in the pan, then set  the heat to medium."
- "Just before it boils, turn the heat down to low. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes. Next, ladle a small amount of the simmering liquid into a small bowl and mix in the miso until it dissolves. Add the dissolved miso to the pot and gently stir to make sure the miso is evenly distributed."
- "Use a spoon to ladle the simmering liquid evenly over the pieces of fish. Cover with an otoshibuta (drop lid) and cook for 5 minutes over medium heat. The miso can scald easily, so be careful."
- "When most of the simmering liquid has boiled down, it&#39;s done. In a short time, you have made simmered mackerel in a glossy sauce. You can also cut about 5 cm of the white part of a Japanese leek and simmer it with the mackerel, which is also delicious."
