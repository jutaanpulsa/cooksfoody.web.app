recipeingredient:
- "1 cup Edamame"
- "4 tbsp Light brown sugar or white sugar"
- "1 dash Salt"
- "180 ml Nonglutinous rice mochi rice 11"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the edamame in salted water. Boiling a little longer than usual will make it easy when smashing them."
- "Remove the edamame from the pods, and remove the thin membrane as well. This takes patience! I get tired halfway through too, but keep at it~."
- "Place the peeled edamame into a mortar, and grind with a wooden pestle. You hit the edamame, so it becomes pounded bean paste (zunda) for the rice cakes . Mash with your willpower!"
- "Once the bean chunks have disappeared, add salt and sugar, and mash even further until smooth. It will be hard if there is not enough sugar, and will be a really loose an paste if there is too much. Adjust to your preference while checking the taste."
- "For those of you who lack willpower, feel free to use a food processor. This will leave behind a few grains, but it will smooth out when you mash it up in a mortar with salt and sugar."
- "Yes! It is done~ . We made a pretty green zunda-an. Good job! You can save this paste in the fridge."
- "As for the ohagi rice cakes, cook mochi rice and non-glutinous rice in a 1:1 ratio, and half-smash in a mortar etc. while it is still hot. Don&#39;t let it live, and don&#39;t kill it..."
- "Roll the rice cakes into easy-to-eat pieces and coat with the paste. Coat the remaining rice cakes in grated sesame. Now, let&#39;s enjoy. These are delicious and homemade."
- "This is a heavy cream and zunda-an paste sandwiches . These are warm and fluffy soft sandwiches. It&#39;s also really good in cream puffs."
- "These are tofu shiratama dango dumplings."
- "Post-script: I was able to make a smooth paste in a food processor. After adding sugar and salt, I blended for longer until it thickened and it turned out ok."
