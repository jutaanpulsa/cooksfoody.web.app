recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a large pot over medium heat. Add chorizo. Crumble to large chunks and begin to brown, stirring often."
- "When chorizo is almost done move to one side of pot. Add ground beef to empty side. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Crumble and brown, stirring often (just the beef side)."
- "When beef is almost done. Add onion. Stir meats and onion together. Allow meats to finish cooking. About 2 minutes."
- "Add beans, corn, El Pato sauce, and tomatoes. Do not stir yet. Smash tomatoes by hand directly in the pot. Add chili seasoning and additional salt to taste. Stir to combine."

- "For tips, see NOTES below ⤵"
- "NOTE: If you feel nervous about smashing up the tomatoes in the pot (like you could burn yourself, which you shouldn&#39;t because you shouldn&#39;t be submerging your hand into anything) smash them up in a separate bowl before adding. I just do them directly in the pot to save a dish. It is wise, though, to utilize your pot lid as a shield to prevent squinting everything with tomato juice and seeds. Lol"
- "NOTE 2: If you can&#39;t find El Pato brand hot tomato sauce in your local market any brand of hot tomato sauce will do (you just need a small can). We just really think El Pato is the best."
- "NOTE 3: For a tasty homemade chili seasoning see the recipe for &#34;chilly chili seasoning&#39; on my page."
