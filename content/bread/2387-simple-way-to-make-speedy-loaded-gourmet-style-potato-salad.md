- "5 lb red potatoes"
- "4 boiled eggs chopped"
- "15 oz Olive oil based miracle whip"
- "6 strips bacon"
- "1/4 cup sliced green onion separated"
- "1/4 tsp celery seed"
- "1/2 tsp black pepper"
- "1 cup grated sharp cheddar"
- "10 oz sour cream"
- "2 tbsp yellow onion diced small"
- "1 tbsp roasted garlic"
- "3 tbsp sweet pickle relish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean and cut potatoes into bite size pieces. Don&#39;t peel them, it&#39;s better this way :-) cook till firm but done"
- "Cook bacon with the small diced yellow onion. I cut the bacon up a little, it&#39;ll cook with the onions more evenly if you do."
- "While the bacon and potatoes are cooking mix the miracle whip, most of the sliced green onion (save a little for garnish), the eggs, relish, pepper, sour cream, roasted garlic, and 3/4 cup (loosely measured) sharp cheddar, and celery seed in small/medium bowl."
- "When the bacon is finished, cool and crumble and add to the miracle whip mixture. Tip; this also makes a really good dip for those chips with ridges ;-) should look roughly like this....."
- "When the potatoes are done, get them out of the hot water and rinse with very cold water. You want to stop the cooking process."
- "Put the potatoes in a large bowl, make a well in the center and pour the miracle whip mixture in. Carefully fold the mix together. Garnish with the green onion and cheese. It&#39;s best if you make it a day ahead and let all those flavors &#39;marry&#39; overnight."
