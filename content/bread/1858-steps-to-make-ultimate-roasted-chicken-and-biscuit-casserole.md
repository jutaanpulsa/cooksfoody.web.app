recipeinstructions:
- "Pre heat oven to 385°"
- "Cover all sides of each piece of chicken with the spice blend, put in a greased baking dish and bake for an hour and a half covered with foil."
- "In a large pot sweat the celery and carrots with the remaining dry spices."
- "When the chicken is done place the thighs into a mixing bowl and let cool. Set the baking dish aside and let stand to let to cool so the fat separates and rises to the top of the juices."
- "Prepare the biscuit dough."
- "When all is cooled remove the skin and bones from the chicken and lightly shred. Leave the peices on the larger side, at least twice the size you would do for a shredded bbq sandwich. Also at this point use a spoon to skim the congealed fat out of the baking dish."
- "Pour the chicken juices from the baking dish into the pot with the celery and carrots. Spread the chicken out in an even layer in the baking dish along with any juices in the bottom of the bowl."
- "Bring the veggies and juices to a simmer then add the white rice flour."
- "Slowly stir in the goats milk and chicken broth. Allow to bubble and thicken. If the consistency isn&#39;t as thick as you would like make a cornstarch slurry and stir in and allow to simmer until raw taste is gone and the sauce thickens. I had to do this step."
- "Stir the frozen peas into the sauce."
- "Pour mix into the baking dish over top the chicken and smooth to an even layer."
- "Use a scoop to evenly drop the biscuit dough over the top."
- "Place the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake uncovered for about and hour... this is all based on how your oven cooks. You&#39;re looking for a good color on the biscuits, the sauce bubbling and the underside of the biscuits to not be raw."
