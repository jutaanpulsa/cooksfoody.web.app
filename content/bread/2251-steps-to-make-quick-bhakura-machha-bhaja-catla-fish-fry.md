recipeingredient:
- "500 gms bengali cut catla fish"
- " One variety of Indian carp You can use any freshwater fish"
- " includes head tail and steakscutlets"
- "0.5 teaspoon turmeric powder"
- "1 teaspoon red chilli powder add as much required"
- " Use Kashmiri red chilli powder for less spice and rich colour"
- "10 teaspoons oil"
- " I have used mustard oil Can use any other oil of your choice"
- "to taste Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean and wash the fish pieces and keep them aside in a large bowl. In a small bowl/plate prepare the masala mix for marination. Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder, salt to taste, mix them well and keep aside. Now using your fingers take some masala mix and rub on all the sides of each fish piece. Cover and keep aside for marination for 15 mins."
- "In a flat pan, heat the oil on low flame till you get the smell of mustard. Mustard oil needs to be heated for sometime before use, otherwise the dish will not taste good. Once the oil is sufficiently hot and smell starts coming then transfer the oil to a bowl and keep it aside for use. (If using olive oil then you can directly pour it by skipping this process. Traditionally mustard oil is used for this dish because of it&#39;s flavour.) Then place the fish pieces on the pan."
- "Now with the help of a teaspoon pour half teaspoon oil on each fish piece (you can pour more or less oil depending on the size of the fish piece). Then pour 1 teaspoon oil around the pan. Cover with lid and cook for 3mins. Remove the lid and keep aside. Turn the fish pieces by using tongs, repeat the process of adding oil on the fish pieces and pan, cover and cook for 3mins. Remove lid and keep aside."
- "Turn the fish pieces using tongs, fry for 2 mins without covering the lid. Now again turn them to the other side and fry for 2mins. Fry till the fish pieces get roasted on each side."
- "Serve hot as an appetizer or can be served as an accompaniment during main.  You can serve it plain or squeeze in some lemon juice and serve it by garnishing with cilantro leaves &amp; onion rings. Serve with any Indian rice or bread variety during main with other accompaniments as per your preference. Goes very well with steamed rice and dal fry.  *(Please note: cook time will vary based on stove and utensils used)  Try it out and post your feedback."
