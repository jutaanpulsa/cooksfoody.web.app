- "1 tbsp Margarine"
- "1 Sliced cheese"

(Oil the bowl beforehand so that the dough doesn&#39;t stick to it.)"
- "(If you have time) Divide the dough into 8 portions, and leave to rest for 10 minutes or so."
- "Form the dough, and cook in a non-stick frying pan without any oil over medium heat, on both sides."
