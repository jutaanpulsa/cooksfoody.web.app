recipeinstructions:

Soak the remaining 4 briefly in water for about a minute, and spread each one out into an aluminum cup cake mold. Pour water into the steamer and start heating it up over a high heat."
- "Sift the cake flour and baking powder into a bowl, and add the sugar. Don&#39;t mix it yet. Add the minced sakura leaves to the milk and mix well, add red food coloring, and dissolve completely. Add to the milk bowl and quickly mix together . You only need a very small amount of red food coloring. If you add too much, don&#39;t blend it completely."
- "Spread out a bit of the dough into the aluminum cups on top of the sakura leaves (optional). Place a small amount aduki beans on top of that. (The photo shows the dough without food coloring added)."
- "Place more dough in top of the an paste, and cover it. Place the sakura flowers on top of that. Use chopsticks to spread out the petals like in the photo . Place into the steamer, steam for 10 minutes, and it is done."
- "For special occasions display buns with and without added food coloring . It&#39;s an added bonus that the red and white colors are symbolic and beautiful."
- "This is how the white bread (without red food coloring) looks like when broken apart. It is fluffy and spongy!"
- "Advice : Measure out the ingredients properly, mix lightly, and please place into a steamer that is properly heated."
