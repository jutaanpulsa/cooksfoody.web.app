recipeingredient:
- "80 g Sourdough starter quite runny straight from fridge"
- "140 g All purpose flour"
- "50 ml water"
- "1 tbsp sunflower sesame or coconut oil"
- "1 tsp sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "In the morning, dissolve the starter in the water and mix in all the other ingredients. Knead just enough to make a dryish dough. Cover with clingfilm and leave to rise at room temp"
- "Throughout the morning, do a cycle of folds every hour or so. Don&#39;t let it get in the way of life though. Missing a few folds won&#39;t hurt."
- "4 hours before dinner, the dough should have doubled in size. Cut the dough into 4 pieces, flatten and shape into buns (do that thing where you stick baking parchment inside so that the two halves don&#39;t stick together). Place on baking parchment. I like to put them inside a steamer at this point so that they are ready to go at dinner time."
- "Put steamer in the oven with the light on (in my oven this gives a temperature of about 40-50C). Leave until dinner time. Don&#39;t be afraid to prove the hell out of the buns. They should really be big and puffy by the end of this step."
- "Buns should be nice and puffed up. Now add cold water to the steamer and put it over a medium heat. When the water starts boiling, start the timer. After 15 or 20 mins they are done!"
