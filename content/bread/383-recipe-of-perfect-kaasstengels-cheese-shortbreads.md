recipeingredient:
- "200 g cheese Edam is better if not then gouda then cheddar grated"
- "500 g mixed butter salted and margarine or 250g each"
- "800 g flour"
- "1 egg yolk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Grate cheese, mix it well with the butter-margarine mix with mixer or by hand inside the large bowl."
- "Add flour little by little, mix everything well."
- "Grease baking tray with margarine using the large brush."
- "Put the batter into the cookie extruder, extrude and cut into matchstick length. If you don&#39;t have any, you can use a rolling pin (or a bottle) then cut into matchstick-long and finger-wide shape. If you feel lazier, you can make ball-shapes, but the crunch will be less satisfactory due to the thickness difference."
- "Mix eggyolk with 1 tablespoon of water inside a small bowl. Brush the top of the kaasstengels for a nice shine. Add a small bit of grated cheese on top for decoration. You can skip the eggwashing step if you like, still tastes good."
- "Preheat the oven (180 degree) for 5 minutes. Bake for 20 minutes and check whether it&#39;s cooked through, if not, add 10 more minutes."
