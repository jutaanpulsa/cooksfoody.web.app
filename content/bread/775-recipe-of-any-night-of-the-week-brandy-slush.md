- "12 oz. can frozen orange juice concentrate"
- "12 oz. can frozen lemonade concentrate"
- "1 cup apricot brandy"
- "1 cup vodka"
- "24 oz. pineapple juice"
- "12 oz. peach mango juice blend"

- "2 empty 175 liter juice bottles to store unfrozen slush"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine everything and mix well. I split the mix between two pitchers and pour back and forth a bunch of times because I don&#39;t own a container large enough to mix it all at once."
- "Pour mixture into empty juice bottles. This will make the next step easier and allow you to store whatever you don&#39;t use into the fridge for later."
- "Pour mixture into ice cube trays and freeze overnight."
- "Once frozen, place cubes into a zip lock freezer bag and mash it into a slush with your bare hands. No, not by squeezing the cubes bare-handed. Seal the bag first and then squeeze."
- "Use a large spoon or ice cream scoop to put slush into a glass and then pour on your favorite citrus-y soda (Sun Drop, Sierra Mist, 7-Up, or similar). I use a 50/50 slush to soda ratio."
