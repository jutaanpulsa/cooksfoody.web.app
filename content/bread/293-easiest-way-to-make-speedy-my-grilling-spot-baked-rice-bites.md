recipeinstructions:

- "Add Salt to taste and keep mixing."
- "Add the Spanish Ñoras. Keep mixing."
- "Add the flour and the Chili Sauce. Mix well one more time."
- "You should get a paste-like texture in your mix."
- "Pour some Olive Oil on a Pan and spread well."
- "Make the Rice Bites with your hands like shown in the picture. Then, put Gouda Cheese pieces on top. It is important that you cover your hands with oil every three bites so they don’t get sticky. Otherwise it will be really messy."
- "Bake the Bites for 20 min at low heat. Then increase the heat until you get a nice brown Cheese layer. This should take another 20 min. The Rice Bite should end up crispy in the outside and soft in the inside. In this case my kids didn’t want their Bites too Brown, I would have broiled them a little bit more."
- "The Sweet Soy Sauce is super easy. Just mix all the ingredients, place the mix on a pan. Cook at high heat, this will take 5 min. It is extremely important you don’t stop storing the sauce while it cooks otherwise it could burn. Cook until you can see the bottom of the pan as shown in the picture."
- "Pour the Sweet Soy Sauce over the Rice Bites. Serve and enjoy!"
