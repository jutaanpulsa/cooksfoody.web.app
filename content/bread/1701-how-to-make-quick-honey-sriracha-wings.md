recipeingredient:
- " Wings"
- "2 lb chicken wings  split at the joints tips removed see step 2"
- "2 tbsp unsalted butter  melted"
- "1 tbsp canola oil"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp sea salt"
- "1/4 tsp black pepper"
- " Glaze"
- "4 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "1 tbsp allpurpose flour optional actually simply helps in thickening and emulsifying glaze"
- "1/3 cup honey"
- "1/3 cup sriracha sauce"
- "1 tbsp soy sauce low sodium is fine"
- "1 tbsp fresh lime juice"
- " Optional garnishes"
- "1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro"
- "1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley"
- "2 tsp sesame seeds  toasted if desired"
- "1 additional honey or leftover glaze  drizzled or brushed over the tops"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray or lightly grease with about 2 tsp canola oil. Set aside."
- "Prep your wings by splitting the wingette from the drumette at the joint, then removing the wing tip, working one by one until all are done. TIP: to easily split wings; hold by large end of drumette, with end of joint resting on cutting surface. Carefully cut through the skin between the drumette and wingette until you reach the joint. To find the joint, grab drumette in one hand, wingette in the other and gently pull away from each other opening the joint until you feel it pop and can see the bone ends. Slide your knife edge into the gap of the joint carefully cutting between the bones to completely separate. The wing tip joint is smaller and sometimes more difficult to find, but if you have a good enough knife you can just chop right through it with one good chop."
- "Place wingettes and drumettes in a large bowl. Place wing tips in a freezer bag, freeze and save for making chicken stock! Mix the next 5 ingredients listed after wings in a small bowl. Drizzle mixture over wings. Using tongs gently toss to coat wings completely. Arrange wings on baking sheet, skin side up (this is the side with more meat on each wing). Place in oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven, using tongs flip wings over, return to oven and bake 15 minutes more."
- "While wings are baking make your glaze. In a small sauce pan over medium heat melt your 4 tbs butter. Add flour, cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly to avoid burning. Add next 5 ingredients in order listed. Stir with a whisk to combine completely. Bring to a low boil, reduce heat to medium low and simmer until thickened slightly, stirring constantly. About 5 - 7 minutes. Remove from heat to wait for glazing time!"
- "Glazing time! After the first 30 minutes in the oven remove your wings once more. Give glaze a quick stir, brush top side of each wing generously. Return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven, flip wings with tongs, brush top side with glaze return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove from oven, do not flip this time, brush with glaze once more and return to oven for yet another 5 minutes. You may do this one to two more times if desired, but I do not recommend longer than 25 minutes total time for the glazing process (55 minutes total cooking time). We are working to get a nice caramelized glaze on the wings, but don&#39;t want the meat to dry out!"
- "When wings are done arrange on a serving platter and top with desired optional garnishes. I like to give mine one final brush of the glaze without returning to the oven, then transfer to platter and sprinkle with fresh chopped cilantro or drizzle with ranch. Serve with ranch and/or blue cheese dressing for dipping and watch them disappear!"
