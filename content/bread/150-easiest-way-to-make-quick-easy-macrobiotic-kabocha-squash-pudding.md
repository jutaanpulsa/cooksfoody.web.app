recipeingredient:
- "160 grams Kabocha squash"
- "100 ml Soy milk"
- "3 tbsp Beet sugar oligosaccharide or maple syrup"
- "1 tbsp Kudzu powder"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 1/2 grams Powdered kanten"
- "3 tbsp Water"
- "1/2 stalk or a few drops Vanilla beans or vanilla essence"
- "1 Steamed azuki beans optional"
- "1 Steamed kabocha squash skin"
- "1 Or kabocha squash seeds"
- "1 Kinako"
recipeinstructions:
- "Steam the kabocha squash, peel the skin, and put into a food processor. (I peeled it this time &#39;round for the sake of the photos, but you can also use unpeeled kabocha. It will result in a pudding with a slightly rougher texture, but it&#39;s still delicious.)"
- "Combine all ○ ingredients in a food processor and blend."
- "Now put all the ● ingredients into a small pan. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 1 minute (to eliminate the grainy texture of kanten)."
- "Add the kanten mixture from Step 3 to the Step 2 blended kabocha mixture, and also add the vanilla beans (if using). Bring it to the boil again and let simmer for 2 and a half minutes until thick and smooth. (The mixture will thicken as a result of heating the kudzu flour.)"
- "Turn the heat off and let it cool down slightly (if you&#39;re using vanilla essence instead of vanilla beans, add it at this point). Pour into a mold and chill in the fridge for an hour."
- "Remove from the mold and slice. Decorate with toppings of your choice. (Here, I used adzuki beans that I already had steamed. They&#39;re unsweetened, but still go great with the pudding)."
- "Also check out my &#34;Macrobiotic Pumpkin Potage and Curry for Kids&#34; []. I always have this up my sleeve for when I&#39;m stuck for something to make."
