recipeingredient:
- "60 grams Shiratamako"
- "40 grams Mochiko or joshinko"
- "80 grams Sugar"
- "140 ml Water"
- "30 grams Kinako"
- "5 grams Cinnamon"
- "1 Anko"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the kinako and cinnamon and spread it out on a work surface. You might think it is a lot, but it is needed to keep the yatsuhashi from sticking."
- "Make the dough. Place the shiratamako into a bowl with water, and mix so that there are no lumps of flour."
- "Add the mochiko, and stir with a spoon. If you add in the sugar and stir some more, it&#39;s strange; the hard dough becomes soft (I mixed it in this order to show my kid, but it is okay to mix the mochiko and sugar in together)."
- "Cover with plastic wrap, and microwave for 2 minutes at 600 W. Take it out once and mix evenly with a wet spoon, cover with plastic wrap again, and microwave for one more minute. It is good to go once it becomes as thick as mochi."
- "Spread out the dough onto the work surface. While coating the dough with kinako and cinnamon, spread it out thinly with a rolling pin. If you stretch it out into a square as much as possible, then there will be no waste when you cut it."
- "Cut into squares with a knife, place the anko on top, fold into a triangle, and it is done."
