- "50 ml Water"
- "1 tsp plus Katakuriko"
- " Dango dumpling"
- "120 grams Mochiko"
- "80 grams Rice flour"
- "110 ml Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "The right is rice flour. In Canada, you can buy it at Bulk Barn or health food stores in your area. The bag on the right is glutinous rice flour. It usually says 水磨糯米粉 in Chinese."
- "Add all ingredients for the dango into a bowl. Add water in small batches and knead until it becomes soft like earlobes."
- "Roll the dough into small balls around the same size. So cute!"
- "Add all ingredients for the mitarashi sauce into a microwave safe bowl. Mix each time in 30 second increments. Repeat until the sauce becomes transparent."
- "Boil water in a pot. Add the dango from Step 3 and boil. It&#39;s cooked when the dango floats up to the top, so scoop it up."
- "Serve with lots of sauce from Step 4 and enjoy. They&#39;ll look cute if you roll them on a plate, or if you can place them on a bamboo skewer to imitate store-bought dango. I didn&#39;t have skewers around this time, so I served them with toothpicks. They look adorable presented this way, too."
