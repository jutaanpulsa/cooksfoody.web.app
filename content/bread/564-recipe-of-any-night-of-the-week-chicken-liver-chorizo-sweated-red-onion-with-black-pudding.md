recipeingredient:
- "380 g chicken livers"
- "50-70 g chorizo cut into 1 cm size pieces"
- "2 medium size red onion chopped"
- "50 g black pudding cut into 1 cm size pieces"
- " olive oil"
- " salt and pepper for seasoning"
- "125 ml px sherry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 120 degrees. Leave livers to one side to bring up to room temperature."
- "Heat a little olive oil in a deep frying pan, cook chorizo over a medium heat. You want to get the fat out of the chorizo without burning it. Turn the chorizo often."
- "When chorizo is ready set aside in a bowl and put in the oven keeping the oil in the pan for the onions."
- "Add onions to pan and cook over a low-medium heat until soft."
- "When onions are soft add to chorizo bowl and return to oven, keep oil in pan for the black pudding."
- "Add black pudding to pan and cook over a medium heat for about 3 mins. You are looking for a slight crisp on the black pudding. When ready add to the chorizo and onion bowl and return to oven keeping any oil left over."
- "Now add oil to pan if needed. Shouldn&#39;t need more than a tbsp or two. This needs to be hot so turn up the heat to high. While you are waiting for it to heat up cut a couple of slithers from a liver. This is for checking if the oil is ready."
- "Gently put a slither of liver into the pan. If it sizzles it&#39;s ready. Put livers into pan and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 mins each side. When ready leave on a plate to rest and remove the chorizo bowl from oven."
- "IMPORTANT. Turn pan to low heat."
- "While everything is resting add the sherry to the pan. Let it reduce. It soaks and reduces all the previous ingredients making a loose paste. Should take 2 mins."
- "Ready to serve now. I put my sauce/paste first on the plate then crumble the black pudding. Chicken livers next (sliced or whole) and the chorizo and onion on the top."
- "Enjoy with wine. Any wine."
