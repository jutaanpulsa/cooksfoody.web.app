- "1 small piece of Cinnamon"
- "4 Cloves"
- "1 medium Onion finely sliced optional"

- "to taste Salt"
- "2 tablespoon Ghee"
recipeinstructions:
- "Method: Wash and soak long grained rice in water for 15 minutes. Drain water and keep them aside. Heat 1 tbsp ghee in a pan. Add cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, bay leaves, pepper corns and cloves; add the sliced onion and sauté till pink. Wash green peas and add to the onions.Mix and sauté for a couple of minutes.Add the salt and add the soaked and drained rice. Gently mix the rice and green peas. I say gently as the long grained rice are very brittle and would break easily."
- "Transfer this rice/peas mixture to the rice cooker and add the water. If cooking in a regular pan then add 1:2 ratio of water. Rice 1 cup then water is 2 cups.  Let the rice cook with the lid on. Do not open the lid in between as the flavors will escape. In the rice cooker once the rice is cooked the light automatically comes down to keep warm. Lift the lid and drizzle one tbsp of ghee over the hot, steaming rice. This gives a boost to all the flavors to waft in the air and has one drooling."
- "Transfer the steaming mutter pulao onto a dish and serve hot with raita, soup, rasam, pickle or it can be eaten just on it&#39;s own."
