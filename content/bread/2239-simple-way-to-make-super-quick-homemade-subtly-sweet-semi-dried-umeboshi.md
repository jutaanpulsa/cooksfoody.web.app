recipeingredient:
- "20 Umeboshi"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "5 tbsp Pancake syrup"
- "1 same as above or use mizuame syrup instead"
- "1 to 2 drops Vanilla essence optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "De-salt the umeboshi: rinse them in water, then soak in a bowl filled with plenty of water and a pinch of salt for an hour."
- "Drain the de-salted umeboshi on paper towels."
- "Put the pancake syrup (or mizuame syrup) in a Tupperware container that the umeboshi will fit in nicely, and add the vanilla essence."
- "Put in the dried umeboshi, and coat them well with the syrup. Put a piece of plastic wrap directly on the umeboshi, and refrigerate. Marinate in the refrigerator for 4 days or so."
- "In 4 days, the moisture and salt in the umeboshi will have been drained out of them nicely, and the syrup will be quite liquid. They already smell fragrant."
- "Take the umeboshi out of the syrup, and pat them dry lightly with paper towels. Line up the umeboshi on a flat sieve or similar."
- "Turn them over occasionally and dry for 4 to 5 days, and they are done. You can dry them for a shorter or longer time as you like."
- "If you take the pits out of the umeboshi after de-salting, they will dry faster. In the wintertime, they will dry out well if you leave them in a dry room."
- "I used this pancake syrup."
