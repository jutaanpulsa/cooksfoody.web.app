recipeingredient:
- "2 boneless ribeye steaks fat removed thinly sliced"
- "1/2 c. cornstarch"

recipeinstructions:
- "Toss the thinly sliced steak pieces in 1/2 c. cornstarch until well coated. Shake off excess and set aside."
- "Whisk together sauce ingredients, including 2 tsp. cornstarch, and set aside."
- "In large, deep skillet heat about 1/2 inch of canola oil on medium-high heat until very hot. Fry steak in 3 batches so as not to crowd in skillet, stirring and tossing (I use a kitchen spider), until crispy, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack on a baking sheet, and keep warm in oven."
- "Remove canola oil from skillet and wipe clean with paper towel."
- "Add sesame oil to skillet, over medium-high heat, and let it get hot. Add snow peas and garlic, tossing to coat with the oil. Cook for 30-60 seconds, add sauce mixture, crispy steak, and green onions and stir to coat. The sauce will thicken quickly. Serve immediately so the snow peas stay crisp and don&#39;t overcook."
- "NOTE: Some may be tempted to leave out the sriracha, but don&#39;t! It&#39;s an important part of the flavor profile. If you don&#39;t like spicy heat, just add 1/4 tsp, or even a little less."
