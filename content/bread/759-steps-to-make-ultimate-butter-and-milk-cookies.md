Hey everyone, it's Brad, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, butter and milk cookies. One of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

If we don&#39;t have buttermilk in the fridge, the closest substitute would be another dairy product with a little acidity added â€” milk with a spoonful of lemon juice or white vinegar does the job quite nicely. This mixture won&#39;t get as thick and creamy as buttermilk, but it will perform its role in the batter just as well. Add condensed milk and beat until soft and fluffy, scraping the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is evenly distributed. See more ideas about Milk n cookies, Milk cookies, Milk.
