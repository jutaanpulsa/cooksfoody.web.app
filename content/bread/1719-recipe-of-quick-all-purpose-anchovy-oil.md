recipeingredient:
- "300 ml Extra virgin olive oil"
- "4 clove Garlic crush with the flat part of a knife"
- "1 Red chili peppers sliced into rounds"
- "8 Anchovy fillets"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the extra virgin olive oil and garlic in a cold pot and heat over low heat."
- "Gradually, you will see small bubbles coming up from the garlic and it&#39;ll start to smell nice. At the same time, prepare a cold wrung-out kitchen towel."
- "Once the garlic starts changing color, scoop out the ones that have turned light brown with a mesh ladle."
- "[Helpful Hints] The garlic aroma of the oil will differ depending on how dark the garlic has been browned. I normally brown garlic like the ones shown in this photo."
- "However, once the garlic browned like in Step 4, they will get dark very quickly. So if you don&#39;t scoop them out from the oil promptly, they will get burnt and spoil the aroma."
- "Until you get used to making this oil, it may be a good idea to scoop the garlic out when the color is little lighter than the photo in Step 4."
- "When you&#39;ve scooped out all the garlic, turn off the heat. Add the anchovy fillets and red chili peppers to the oil, then stir lightly."
- "As soon as you finished stirring the oil, place the pan from Step 7 on the cold wrung out kitchen towel from Step 2. The anchovy oil is ready. Let it cool naturally."
- "Once the anchovy oil has cooled completely, transfer to a sterilized jar to store. Transfer all the anchovy bits from the pan as well."
- "The anchovy bits tend to sink to the bottom of the jar. Use only the oil, or use the oil with the other ingredients depending on the dish."
- "Not only for pasta or ajillo, you can make a salad dressing by adding white wine vinegar, salt and pepper to this oil. It is so versatile!"
- "This is roasted asparagus with anchovy oil. I put asparagus in a heat resistant dish, added this anchovy oil, seasoned with salt and pepper, and roasted in the oven."
- "Use the oil with the anchovy settled at the bottom and roast in the oven for 10 minutes at 250°C. You can make a delicious dish like this very easily using the anchovy oil."
- "This is a variation of this oil, &#34;Sundried Tomatoes Marinated in Oil&#34;.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/172239-all-purpose-dried-tomatoes-marinated-in-anchovy-oil"
- "This is another variation of this oil, &#34;Grilled Eggplant Marinated in Oil&#34;. These are both my favorites!"
- "&#34;Authentic Peperoncino With Anchovies&#34;. It&#39;s very nice if you drizzle a little anchovy oil over this kind of oil-based pasta.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/171841-authentic-peperoncino-with-anchovies"
- "[Note] The spiciness of the oil differs depending on when you add the red chili peppers to the oil."
- "I add the red chili peppers between Step 2 and Step 3, but I think adding them in Step 7 is better for most people."
- "The amount of anchovy fillets in this recipe suits various dishes."
- "I tend to change up how I make the anchovy oil depending on what I&#39;m making. Like adding an extra anchovy fillet, for example."
- "I uploaded &#34;Very Useful Garlic Chips and Garlic Oil&#34;. This oil is also very convenient, and I always have it stocked all year round."
