recipeinstructions:

Remove the bacon to paper towels to drain."

- "Toast bread in toaster oven, skillet or oven. How to is in next step."
- "Spread about 1 teaspoon of mayonnaise on 1 side of each piece of bread. Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and heat over medium heat. In the skillet, place as many slices of bread that will fit, mayo side down, and griddle them up until the mayo side of the bread is nicely browned, about 1 minute. Remove the bread from the skillet, let rest browned side up, and griddle up any remaining slices."
- "Place 4 of the slices of toast browned side down on a cutting board. Place a tomato on each piece, season lightly with salt and pepper, place 4-6 slices of bacon on each slice of tomato, add cheese of your choice. Then add 1 over medium egg and top with a couple of pieces of lettuce. Generously spread the rest of the mayo on the non-browned side of the remaining slices of bread, and top the sandwiches with the second piece of bread. Slice in half and you&#39;re good to go."
- "More ideas to make your blt plus. You can add grilled or caramelized onions, or a thin slice of raw onion, swap out the plain lettuce for arugula or watercress, or a blend of lettuce. You can Change out the bacon for pancetta. You can add a slice of avocado or make a quick guac-ish mash smash up some avocado with lime juice and maybe some minced scallion or minced cilantro. Either addition is great or just make a classic blt. Bacon Lettuce Tomato sandwich."
- "Enjoy."
