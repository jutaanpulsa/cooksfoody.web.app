recipeingredient:
- "100 g starter"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
- "1 tsp salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you&#39;ve just fed your starter, mix everything together and leave it for a few hours. If you fed your starter a few hours ago, mix it with the baking powder and salt and cook it straight away."
- "The consistency of your mixture determines the crumpetyness of your Cruffins. A more liquid (ie. batter-like) mixture will produce something more like a crumpet, while a thicker mixture (but not quite thick enough to be called a dough) will produce something towards the muffin end of the spectrum. So adjust the consistency of your mixture with water or flour to get the desired consistency."
- "Heat a frying pan (medium heat) and muffin/egg rings. If you are going for something more muffiny, the batter will be thicker so you don&#39;t need the rings unless you want perfect round shapes."
- "Spoon/pour in the batter. Don&#39;t fill the rings completely - the crumpets will grow! Cook until the bubbles come out the top and the top dries out, about 3-4 minutes (the one in the picture is half dry, so needs a little more). If your bottoms burn before this happens, then next time try reducing the temperature or adding less batter. You can then flip and cook for a minute or so on top. Or if you really want to preserve your bubble holes, you can grill them in the oven for a min or two."
