recipeingredient:
- "50 grams Fresh okara"
- "1 tbsp Katakuriko"
- "1 as much to taste Kinako and sugar or kuromitsu and kinako"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a microwave-safe deep dish, add the okara and katakuriko and mix well. At first the katakuriko will be dry, but keep mixing it and the mixture will gradually come together."
- "Without covering, microwave (my microwave was set at 500 W) for 1 minute, then take out of the microwave to stir very well. Since the mixture is very hot, use a spoon to stir the dough."
- "Keep mixing well until the dough is springy, and shape into balls. The dough is hot so I recommend you use a spoon to shape them."
- "Sprinkle your desired ratio of kinako and sugar or coat with kuromitsu and then sprinkle with kinako. Enjoy while fresh, soft, and chewy."
- "By the way, when using half the amount listed (25 g of okara and 1/2 tablespoon of katakuriko) it only takes 30 seconds to cook in my microwave. For a simpler version, use half the amount of ingredients and enjoy anytime."
