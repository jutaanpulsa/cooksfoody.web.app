- "125 grams Bread flour"
- "125 grams All purpose flour"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "20 grams Trehalose"
- "3 Egg yolk"
- "80 grams Unsalted butter"
- "30 ml Heavy cream"
- "1 enough to make 160 ml when combined with egg yolk and cream Water"

- "4 grams Instant dry yeast"
- "1 to glaze Beaten egg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Beat the egg yolk well and mix with the cream and water."
- "Put all of the ingredients except for the butter in the bread maker and set it to the bread kneading course. Place the yeast according to the manufacturers instructions."
- "Add 1/3 of the butter 3 minutes after starting the course, then another 1/3 after a further 3 minutes and then the last 1/3 after another 3 minutes."
- "Leave everything in the bread maker until it&#39;s finished proofing."
- "Once proofed, take out the dough, and punch it down to get rid of the gas. Use a scraper to divide the dough into 12, moulding them into rounds. Each round should weigh around 45 g."

- "Make the lump quite narrow and put the dough into aluminium cups. Push the lump down gently to flatten a little. The butter will begin to melt here, so do this step as quickly as possible."
- "Proof for a second time in the oven for 35 - 45 minutes at 35℃. When the dough has expanded 1.5x the original size it&#39;s ready. The picture shows the dough after the second proofing."

- "Bake for 12 minutes at 200℃. Please adjust the cooking time according to your oven. Once a nice golden colour, they&#39;re ready."
- "This is how they look inside when baked. The inside is really chewy, and a nice yellow color, and the smell is fantastic."
