recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C"
- "To make the tart crust, combine the flour and salt, and lightly sift them together. Add small portions of the ice water and oil alternately while mixing."
- "Once the dough has come together, knead it, and spread it flat."
- "The dough will be quite sticky, so sandwich it between two sheets of waxed paper to make it easier to work."
- "Oil and dust your tart pan with flour (omitted from ingredients list). As best as you can, transfer your dough sheet into the pan, making it as neat as possible."
- "Bake it in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes."
- "While it is baking, prepare the filling. Mix the flour and sugar. If you are going to add the egg, drop it in now and whisk together vigorously."

- "Whatever you choose, once the filling is well mixed, heat over low heat (you can make the filling entirely in this one pot )"
- "Be careful to stir continuously."
- "When the mixture has thickened, mix the filling well, scraping the bottom of the pan. Make sure the filling doesn&#39;t burn."
- "The filling will thicken more as it cools."
- "For the topping, open the can of peaches and cut them into thin slices."
- "Pour a bit of the peach juice into a small pot and heat it to reduce it into a thickened syrup."
- "The tart crust should be done now, so take it out of the oven and remove it from the pan. Spread the filling evenly into the crust."
- "Set the peach slices on top, and finally pour the syrup over the tart."
- "It is even prettier if you garnish the top your tart with a little bit of colourful mint."
