recipeingredient:
- " For the shio koji"
- "400 grams Koji freeze dried available in Japanese supermarkets or fresh koji"

recipeinstructions:
- "Make the shio-koji: Put the shio-koji ingredients in a storage container and leave at room temperature. Mix it up once a day. In 7 to 10 days, when it becomes thick and porridge-like and the rice grains start falling apart, it&#39;s done. Store in the refrigerator."
- "The innoculated rice grains (the koji) will absorb water as it matures, so keep adding more water every 2 to 3 days so that the grains are always covered. Add up to 1.5 times the amount of rice in water."
- "Make the salt pork: Spread the shio-koji evenly over the surface of the pork. Wrap in paper towels, then wrap again in plastic wrap. Put the wrapped meat in a plastic bag and refrigerate."
- "After 2 to 3 days the meat will be cured and become a pretty pink color. Moisture will come out of the meat too, so change the paper towels. The meat is ready to eat in 3 days, up to 10 days."
- "This pork has been cured for 10 days and cut into 1 cm thick slices. Just pan fry in a frying pan without any added oil over medium-low heat.  Don&#39;t wipe the shio-koji off; it burns easily though so pay attention!"
