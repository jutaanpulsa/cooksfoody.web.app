recipeingredient:
- " For the Sourdough"
- "300 g rye flour"
- "30-50 g oldstale bread turned into breadcrumbs"
- "10 g rye sourdough starter"
- "260 g warm water"
- " Main dough"
- "500 g warm water"
- "22 g salt"
- "150 g oldstale bread turned into breadcrumbs"
- "700 g rye flour"
- "4 g malt syrup or molasses or honey"
- "17 g fresh yeast or 5 g dry yeast"
- " Optional Mixins"
- "2 tsp caraway seeds"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the sourdough ingredients: First mix 300 g rye flour and 30-50 g breadcrumbs from old bread (more will make the bread more chewy and have a nice aroma)."
- "Put the sourdough starter on the flour and pour the warm water over it. Mix with your hands until no longer floury. Cover and let rise for 12-16 hours at room temp."
- "After the sourdough part is done, it&#39;s time to mix the main dough. First dissolve salt in 500 g warm water."
- "Put another 150 g of breadcrumbs made from stale/dry bread into a bowl. Pour the salt water over the breadcrumbs, mix and let soak for 1 hour in a warm place."
- "In another bowl, lightly mix the 700 g rye flour with the malt syrup/molasses and yeast. In a separate large bowl, add the breadcrumb water, then add the flour mix, and then sourdough on top."
- "Mixing from around the edges, gradual work the liquid into the rye flour. When the liquid is all absorbed and roughly mixed, move to next step."
- "Next work the dough from the center with your hands, squeezing and bringing together until there&#39;s no more flour visible and no more crumbly pieces."
- "Once the ball of dough comes together, remove to working surface and cut in two. Fold in caraway seeds if you like here."
- "Pattern 1 - for bread with big beautiful cracks in the surface (the bread on the right side in the main photo - Form the dough into a round ball by folding the edges down and around toward the bottom center. Instead of closing the fold neatly, leave it rough and open."
- "Put rough fold side down into flour dusted banneton."
- "Pattern 2 - for a pretty crackled patter like the bread on the left side in the main photo - Form into a smooth ball, then moisten the top and sides by rolling on a moist towel. Roll in rye flour and place top up in a well floured banneton."
- "Let the dough rise 2-3 hours until fully proofed."
- "For pattern 1 bread: Gently tip the banneton over and let the dough slide out into your hand (the fold side that was at the bottom of the banneton will be on top). Place the dough fold side up on a baking sheet (the dough on the left side in the photo)."
- "For pattern 2 bread: Tip the banneton over and let the dough slide into your hand. Flip it back over so the flour covered, cracked surface is on top (the side that was at the top in the banneton will be at the top again)."
- "Bake for 40 minutes at 260°C/500°F with steam. After first 5 minutes release steam and lower temperature to 250°C/480°F and bake for another 25 minutes. Then lower temperature again to 200°C/400°F and bake another 20 minutes. Check doneness by tapping the bottom of the bread - if it sounds hollow it&#39;s finished. If not bake for a few more minutes."
