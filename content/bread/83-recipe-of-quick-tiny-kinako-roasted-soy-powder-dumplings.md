- "Add the dissolved starch syrup to the kinako mixture, a little at a time, and knead it into a soft dough a bit firmer than your ear lobe. If it&#39;s a little too firm even after adding all of the starch syrup, mix in a small amount of water, a little at a time."
- "Roll the dough into 1.5 cm balls, then coat in granulated sugar. Skewer two dumplings each on toothpicks, then serve. It&#39;s like a Japanese confectionery to go with a cup of matcha or green tea."
