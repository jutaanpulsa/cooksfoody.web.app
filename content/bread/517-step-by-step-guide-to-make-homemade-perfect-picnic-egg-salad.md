I love deviled eggs, but they are finicky little buggers, particularly if you&#39;re prone to being overly precious with presentation. This might be a &#34;me&#34; issue, but peeling, scooping, and refilling the eggs without marring the white has always stressed me out. Eating egg salad can be very healthy for you as long as you do not overeat. This recipe only has a little bit of mayonnaise in it making it a great low carb meal.
