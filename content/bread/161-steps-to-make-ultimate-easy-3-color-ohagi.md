recipeingredient:
- "180 ml Mochi rice"
- "190 ml Water"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "200 grams Readymade tsubuan chunky sweet bean paste and koshian smooth sweet bean paste"
- "1 tbsp Kinako"
- "1 tsp Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Black sesame seeds"
- "1 tsp Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the rice, drain and put into a pot. Add the specified amount of water, and leave to soak for about 20 minutes."
- "While the rice is soaking... Mix the ingredients marked ◆ together to make the kinako coating for the ohagi."
- "Make the black sesame coating... Grind up the black sesame seeds well in a grinding bowl (suribachi). Add the sugar marked ☆ and mix well. (You can use pre-ground sesame seeds instead!)"
- "If the storebought anko (sweet bean paste) you are using is loose or watery, heat up in a pan to evaporae the moisture, and leave to cool. You should have about 200 g of anko after the moisture has evaporated."
- "Cover the rice pot with a lid and start heating over high heat. When it comes to a boil, turn the heat down immediately to very low, and cook for 12 minutes. Turn off the heat, and leave the rice to steam and rest for 10 minutes."
- "Sprinkle in the salt and mix well. Use a moistened pestle or rolling pin to partially crush the rice. You should still see some rice grains in the mashed up rice."
- "Moisten your hands, and form 6 dumplings with the mashed rice."
- "For regular ohagi: Form the dumplings into oval shapes, and cover with anko (sweet bean paste). (This is easy if you spread the anko on a piece of plastic wrap, place the rice dumpling on top and then wrap the anko around it.)"
- "Make the kinako ohagi: Flatten out one of the rice dumplings on a moistened palm, add 1 tablespoon of anko in the middle, wrap the rice around it, and coat the dumpling with the kinako mixture from step 2."
- "Make the black sesame ohagi: Add 2 teaspoons of the ground sesame mixture from step 3 to the remaining anko. Wrap it in the rice as with the kinako ohagi, and coat the dumpling with the remaining black sesame mix."
- "Line them up on a plate, and the 3-colored ohagi are complete! Optionally mix in some ground sesame seeds into the anko for the black sesame ohagi."
