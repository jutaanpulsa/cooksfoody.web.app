recipeingredient:
- "350 grams 1 Chicken breast with skin"
- "1 tsp Salt"
- "2 to 3 tablespoons Sake"
- "1 tbsp Vegetable oil"
- " Accompaniments"
- "1/2 bunch Spinach"
- "1/2 bag Bean sprouts"
- "1/3 tsp Salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sprinkle the salt and sake onto the chicken breast, and massage it into the meat well. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour (in a plastic bag is fine), but up to one full day is OK!"
- "Heat a frying pan and once it starts to smoke, drizzle in the vegetable oil."
- "Place the chicken breast into the pan, skin side down."
- "Immediately bring the heat to low, cover, and cook for 8 minutes. Make sure the heat is low enough that the lid does not move from the steam."
- "Make sure that the lid makes a tight seal."
- "Once 8 minutes have passed, flip over the chicken breasts and cook for about three minutes. You should have about this level of browning for a good flavor."
- "Make sure to cover the pan when cooking on the other side for 3 minutes. Once it is cooked, wrap in aluminum foil. Wrap it while it&#39;s still very hot. Turn off the heat at this point."
- "Place the chicken into a pot or on a plate and wrap tightly, and let sit for 30 minutes. If you can, place a newspaper or towel over the top to keep it warm! A pot lid is also OK."
- "Remove the aluminum foil. On a cutting board, cut the meat into 5 mm slices. Return the juice left in the aluminum foil to the frying pan."
- "Turn the heat on and once the juices start to foam, add the spinach and bean sprouts and stir fry."
- "Once the vegetables have been well coated and have soaked up most of the juices, it&#39;s finished. Don&#39;t forget to taste and add salt and pepper as necessary!"
- "Pile the vegetables on the plate, lay the chicken neatly out on top, add some sauce and you&#39;re done! The photo shows 8 mm slices, but slices thinner than 5 mm are best."
- "Anyway, you&#39;ll be surprised by how tasty it is. If you close your eyes, you wouldn&#39;t even realize it&#39;s chicken breast, since it&#39;s so tender and delicious."
- "If you need more flavor, drizzle your favorite dressing on top. Sesame dressing goes quite well."
