recipeingredient:
- "3 lbs ground beef"
- "2 sticks chorizo"
- "1 white onion diced"
- "5-6 petite sweet peppers diced"
- "2 jalapeo diced"
- "1 clove garlic diced"
- "1 cup water"
- "2 cans rotel tomatoes and green chiles"
- "2 cup tomato sauce"
- "1 can whole kernel corn drained"
- "1 can black beans drained"
- "3 packets chili seasoning"
- "3 tbsp cumin powder"
- "1/2 cup rough chopped cilantro"
- " Black pepper"
- " Onion salt"
- " Shredded cheddar cheese"
- " Sour cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "As always, prep your ingredients before you do anything. Brown the ground beef and chorizo. Barely. I say barely because you want to just get it started cooking. There should be a lot of red still left in it. Drain all fat. (You want to release the rest of the fat in the next step)"
- "After draining the fat, add all of your diced ingredients, black pepper and onion salt to the beef, continue until the beef is completely browned. (We&#39;re sautéing the veggies a bit in the fat as we&#39;re finishing browning the beef)"
- "Transfer your beef mixture into a large pot. Add the ro-tel tomatoes, tomato sauce and water. Heat until it starts bubbling."
- "After the mix is heated well add your corn and black beans. Heat through again.  Now add the rest of the ingredients except the cheese and sour cream. Heat until bubbling again while stirring."
- "The hard part is over! Lower heat almost all the way and cover. Wait about 10-15 minutes and check it. It should be bubbling very gingerly. You don&#39;t want a boil but you also want some sort of movement.  Let sit on stove like that about 2 hours, stirring about every 15 minutes or so."
- "Remove from heat. Serve in a large bowl with some shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of thick sour cream and enjoy!  This stuff actually seems to taste even better reheated as leftovers!  &#34;It&#39;s just the way she goes, Rick&#34;-- Ray(RIP)"
