recipeingredient:
- "4 slices uncooked thick sliced bacon"
- "2 stalks celery diced"
- "2 large carrots peeled and diced"
- "1/2 yellow onion diced"
- "3 cloves garlic minced"
- "2 cans cannellini beans drained and rinsed"
- "3 cups unsalted chicken broth"
- "1/2 cup half and half or heavy cream"
- "1/2 tsp. each salt dried rosemary"
- "1/4 tsp. each dried thyme pepper"
- "1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese"
- "2 packed cups roughly torn kale"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by dicing up the bacon. The easiest way to do this is to pop the slices in the freezer for 20-30 minutes, until it firms up, then take it out and snip it with some sharp kitchen shears. Hands down, this is the easiest way to cut up raw bacon."
- "In a large pot over medium-high heat, cook the chopped bacon until it is browned and crispy. Then remove the bacon with a slotted spoon to a towel lined plate, but leave about 1 tbsp. of the drippings in the pot. Add the celery, onion and carrot to the pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften up, about 5 or so minutes. Then add the garlic and cook another minute or so, until fragrant."
- "Add the drained beans, broth, cream and seasonings to the pot and give it all a good stir. Let it come up to a low boil. Then reduce the heat down a bit and let everything simmer for about 20 or so minutes. At this point, taste it and add any additional seasonings that you think it needs."
- "Remove the pot from the heat and use an immersion blender to give the soup a couple of quick blitzes, until it&#39;s your desired consistency. Or you could just blend half the soup in a blender, then stir it back in. Then immediately stir in the parmesan cheese, the cooked bacon and the kale. Once the greens wilt into the soup, you&#39;re ready to serve."
