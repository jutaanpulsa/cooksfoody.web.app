recipeingredient:
- "400 to 500 grams Pork belly block"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "2 heaping tablespoons Grated onion"
- "2 1/2 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "2 1/2 tbsp Oyster sauce"
- "1 tbsp Shaoxing wine"
- "1 tbsp Sesame oil"
- "1/2 tsp Grated garlic"
- "4 tbsp Water"
- "2 tsp of water  1 teaspoon katakuriko potato starch flour Katakuriko slurry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut off excess fat from the pork belly and divide into 2 pieces. Cut to an even thickness. Stab the meat many, many times with a fork."
- "Put the pork pieces in a plastic Ziploc bag. Rub sugar into all sides and leave for 30 minutes. You can use honey instead of sugar!"
- "Put the ＊ ingredients in a container and mix well."
- "Add the ＊ ingredients to the bag with the pork, and flatten the bag as possible to eliminate air. Flatten the bag so that the meat is completely immersed in the marinade and leave in the refrigerator overnight."
- "Preheat the oven to 480°F/250°C. Transfer the contents of the bag to a small pan. Drain the marinade from the meat, and line the pieces in a roasting pan."
- "Roast at 480°F/250°C on one side for 7 minutes, turn and roast for another 7 minutes. I used a roll cake pan as a roasting pan."
- "The roasting time differs depending on how thick the meat is. If the juices run clear when you poke a piece with a skewer, the meat is done."
- "Add 4 tablespoons of water to the marinade in the small pan and bring to a boil. Simmer over low heat and add the katakuriko dissolved in water to thicken. Don&#39;t thicken too much though."
- "Slice the roasted meat 1 cm thick, spoon the sauce over it and serve."
- "You can store the marinated pork in step 4 in the freezer. Take it out of the freezer and put into the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook it, and let it defrost naturally. Or you can put the frozen bag in a bowl of cold water to defrost."
- "If you roast the meat wrapped in foil, it will be even juicier.  The roasting time differs depending on the pieces of pork, so watch it as it cooks."
- "You can use lamb chops instead of pork. If you bring defrosted lamb chops when you go camping, everyone will love you!"
