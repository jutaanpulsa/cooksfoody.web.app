recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the apple vinegar and sugar in a pot, and bring to a boil. Coarsely chop the ingredients marked ☆ beforehand. Add them in the pot once the mixture in the pot comes to a boil."
- "Dice the ingredients marked ★, and add them in the pot. I like chunky chutney, so I dice them into larger pieces."
- "Add the coriander, mustard seeds, bay leaf and rock salt, and simmer over low heat."
- "Check the pot and stir occasionally. The photo shows what the mixture would be after cooking for 1 hour. Add lemon juice, and it&#39;s done."

- "I often make the chutney in bulk because it&#39;s good for food preservation. If you make only one jar of it, reduce the amount of the ingredients by a quarter. Simmering time would be shorter as well."
- "If you like smooth chutney, finely chop the ingredients at Step 2 or use a blender at Step 4. Be careful not to burn yourself if you use a hand blender."
- "The best time to eat would be about a week later, but taste it before you serve. I spread it on an open sandwich made with homemade bread and cheese. The chutney is mild and not so sour."
