recipeingredient:
- "150 grams All purpose flour"
- "80 grams Mochiko"
- "20 grams Rice flour"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "150 ml Boiling water"
- "1 Sweet potato"
- "200 grams Sweet adzuki bean paste chunky type"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the sweet potato, slice into 1 cm rounds, and soak in salt water to keep the color from changing. (Salt not listed)."
- "I used homemade tsubu-an. Use whatever anko is available."
- "In a large bowl, add dry ingredients and hot water while mixing with a fork. (Be careful not to burn yourself.)"
- "Although it&#39;s hot to handle, form the dough into a ball. Knead until the consistency is smooth, wrap with plastic wrap to keep it from drying out, then let sit for about 15 minutes."
- "Take out as many sweet potatoes as you will need, rinse off the salt, and wipe the excess water with paper towels. Spread a generous amount of anko on top of each slice."
- "Remove enough dough to wrap around a slice of sweet potato, and using your palm and fingers, flatten and stretch into a circle. (You can also use a rolling pin, if necessary.)"
- "Use both hands to wrap the dough completely around the anko and sweet potato."
- "Line the steamer with a cloth and steam for about 30 minutes on high heat (or until a skewer lightly inserted into the sweet potato pierces though completely.)"
- "Wrap in plastic wrap as soon as the residual heat has dissipated. It also tastes delicious while still hot."
