recipeingredient:
- "50 grams Warabi mochiko"
- "25 grams Cane Sugar or dark brown sugar"
- "230 ml Water"
- "4 tsp Kinako"
- "1 Kinako"
- "1 Kuromitsu"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the warabi mochiko and the brown sugar into a pot. Gradually add water while stirring with a rubber spatula to dissolve."
- "Turn the heat to medium and stir constantly. When it becomes transparent and elastic, keep stirring for just 1 more minute. Come on! You can do it!"
- "Sprinkle 2 teaspoons kinako in a tray (or a deep plate) and pour in the completed warabi mochi mixture. Sprinkle another 2 teaspoons of kinako and shake it around."
- "When the mixture has cooled down until warm to the touch, use a rubber spatula or a scraper to cut into bite-sized pieces and place them on a plate. They taste even better after chilling in the refrigerator!! I recommend enjoying them with brown sugar syrup drizzled on top."
- "This is also slightly sweet and yummy simply dusted with kinako. But I think drizzling brown sugar syrup is even more delicious."
- "With kuromitsu poured over them!"
- "This is what it looks like after being placed in a moistened container and put into the refrigerator to chill and harden, then cut with a moistened knife. I dusted with kinako using a tea strainer. I made this one with brown sugar."
- "You can also put the warabi mochi in this Japanese-style parfaitIt&#39;s delicious ~"
