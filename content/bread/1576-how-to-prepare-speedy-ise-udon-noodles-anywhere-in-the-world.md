- "Bring the combined sake and mirin to a boil in a pan. Make sure not to boil it dry."
- "Turn off the heat. Add the bonito flakes, and konbu seaweed that&#39;s been moistened in water."

- "Warm up the serving bowls. Drain the cooked noodles and put in the bowls."
- "Warm up 1/4 of the sauce (for 4 servings) and pour over the noodles. Top with the chopped green onions and kamaboko slices and serve. Mix everything together well to eat."
- "These are the soy sauces I used. The flavor of the sauce can vary a lot depending on the brand of soy sauce you use."
