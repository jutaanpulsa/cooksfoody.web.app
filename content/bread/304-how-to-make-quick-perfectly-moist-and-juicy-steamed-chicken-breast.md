recipeingredient:
- "1 large boneless chicken breast"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 slice fresh ginger or try a bay leaf and thyme"
- "1 green onion top or 14 onion sliced"
- "50 ml white wine sake or water a bit less thatn 14 cup"
- "to taste pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you have time, I highly recommend sprinkling the chicken with salt one day before. This lets the flavor soak in and makes the meat more tender."
- "It&#39;s not necessary, but I usually cut a couple of shallow slices, or poke holes into to the thickest parts of the breast to help make sure the heat reaches through the entire piece."
- "Add onion tops, ginger and chicken skin-side down to a heavy pot. If you didn&#39;t salt the chicken the day before, sprinkle in the salt now and pour in the wine/sake/water."
- "Bring the wine/sake/water to a simmer on medium heat. Cover with lid, turn heat to low and let cook for 5-6 minutes."
- "After 5 minutes, turn off heat and let the pot sit as is, with the lid on. It usually takes 10-15 minutes for the chicken to finish, depending in how big the breast is and whether or not you cut small slices in it."
- "Cut into the thickest part to make sure the chicken is cooked. If it&#39;s still too pink, recover pot and let sit for a few more minutes. (or steam for another 1 minute)"
- "Once it&#39;s done, slice into pieces or pull apart with fingers. Sprinkle on some pepper if you like. You can eat right away or save any chicken that you don&#39;t use right away in the refrigerator for a couple of days! To keep it moist, save the chicken along with the juices from the pot."
