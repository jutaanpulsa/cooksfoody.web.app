recipeingredient:
- "120 grams Koshian"
- "50 grams Shiratamako"
- "100 ml Water"
- "60 grams White sugar"
- "15 grams Mizuame"
- "1 Uguisu flour green kinako or soy bean flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "You just need to use a kitchen scale and a heatproof container. Add the ingredients in the listed order. The dough is made in the microwave, at 600 W."
- "Divide the koshi-an into 6 portions. If you measure the anko so that each portion weighs 20 g, the finished mochi cake will be just the right size."
- "These photo only show 5 -- they&#39;re from when I wanted to try making it with 5 big pieces, but the mochi cakes were too big and not very cute, so I&#39;d stick with 6!"
- "Put the shiratamako and 50 ml of water in a heatproof container, and mix well. Add the remaining 50 ml of water and white sugar, and mix again."
- "Microwave for 1 minute. The perimeters of the dough will thicken first. Mix the whole thing up well with a sturdy spoon or wooden spatula."
- "Microwave for another minute. The dough will thicken quite a bit. Mix again (or rather, knead it). It will be very sticky."
- "Microwave for another minute, and knead again. It will have a mochi-like consistency at this stage."
- "Add the mizuame, and microwave for 40 seconds. Knead. It will be shiny and mochi-like. The dough is now finished."
- "Use the uguisu flour as the dusting flour. Don&#39;t use too much or it will go to waste. Just use enough."
- "(There&#39;s too much uguisu flour in the photo!! Just dust the dough lightly so that it doesn&#39;t stick to your hands!!)"
- "Dust a shallow tray lightly with the uguisu flour, and put the cooked mochi dough onto it. Divide the mochi into 6 portions."
- "Press the mochi out thin, top with a ball of the koshi-an, and close it up. Don&#39;t worry if some of the uguisu flour gets inside."
- "Once the mochi is closed, place it on top of the uguisu flour like this, then place the cake in a No. 6 aluminium cupcake cup."
- "Dust with some more uguisu flour using a tea strainer to finish."
