recipeinstructions:
- "Mix ingredients into blender and purée. Refrigerate until ready to use."
- "Pat the pork chops thoroughly dry with paper towels."
- "In a small bowl combine the paprika, salt, and pepper."
- "Sprinkle both sides of all the pork chops evenly with the spice mixture. Set aside the chops while you prepare the pan."
- "Mince the garlic, grate the ginger, and dice the onion. Add the olive oil, garlic, and ginger to a deep skillet, Dutch oven, or soup pot. Sauté the garlic and ginger over medium heat for 1 minute, or just until the garlic becomes soft and fragrant"
- "Add the diced onion to the skillet and continue to sauté over medium until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the curry powder and continue to sauté for about one minute more to toast the spices."
- "Add the dry lentils and vegetable broth to the skillet. Stir to dissolve any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.

- "After simmering for 20 minutes the lentils should be tender and most of the broth absorbed. Add the can of coconut milk and stir to combine. Turn the heat back up to medium and allow the skillet to come back up to a simmer. Let it simmer without a lid for an additional 10 minutes, stirring often, to thicken the mixture."
- "Once thickened, turn the heat off. Add the fresh spinach and stir gently until the spinach has wilted. Taste the mixture and adjust the salt or curry powder to your liking, if needed. Add the peppers, stir and let rest."
- "Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the surface of the pan is hot, add the oil and heat until the oil shimmers. Add the pork chops–they should make a bright sizzling sound immediately upon touching the pan; if they don&#39;t, take them out and let the pan and oil get a bit hotter."
- "Reduce the heat to medium and cook the chops, undisturbed, until they&#39;re well browned and they release from the pan of their own accord, about 4 minutes. Turn and repeat on the other side."
- "Remove the chops from pan and let sit, covered loosely with foil, for about 10 minutes. Serve hot."
- "Serve and enjoy!"
