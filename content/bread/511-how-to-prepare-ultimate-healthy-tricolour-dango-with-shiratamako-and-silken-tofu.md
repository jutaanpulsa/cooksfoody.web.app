recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Shiratamako"
- "200 grams Silken tofu"
- "1/4 tsp Matcha"
- "2 small pinches or more Red food colouring use sparingly and see how it goes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the shiratamko and silken tofu together. To make tricolour dango, divide the dough into 3 equal portions."
- "Add the matcha to one portion and mix well to make a green dough. To make a pink dough, add the food colouring to another portion. Add the food colouring sparingly and see how it goes. Otherwise the food colouring may give too strong a colour to the dough."
- "Make small balls with the dough and arrange them onto a dish. Put the balls into the boiling water. Once they start to float up to the surface take them out and put them in a bowl of cold water."
- "Skewer 3 balls of dango with a toothpick and transfer to a serving dish. It&#39;s done!"
- "To make a rabbit face, first make a ball with plain dough. Put two small pink cheeks on the ball. Make 2 oblongs with plain dough to make ears. Cook them in boiling water."
- "After cooking put 2 black sesame seeds on the face to make eyes. Use a piece of dried pasta to stick the ears to the face. For the ear decoration, I used puffed rice pellets (called &#34;bubu arare&#34; in Japan)."
