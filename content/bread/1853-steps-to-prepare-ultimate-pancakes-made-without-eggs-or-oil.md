- "5 ml Lemon juice optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place 2 gas burners on top of each other (to create a little distance from the flame). Make sure that they are stable."
- "Mix together the powdered ingredients. Of course it&#39;s perfectly okay to sift them together."
- "Add the soy milk or cow&#39;s milk and cut in. Once it becomes slightly thick, it&#39;s ready."
- "Heat up a frying pan, place it on a damp dish towel for 3 minutes, and then reheat."
- "If you have a Teflon pan, you don&#39;t need to add oil. If you don&#39;t use Teflon pans, use a paper towel to lightly coat the entire frying pan surface with oil."
- "Turn the heat to medium. Pour the batter into the center of the frying pan on the top burner. Cover with a lid and cook on medium heat for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes."
- "When it begins to bubble slightly, flip it over, cover with the lid, and cook on low heat for 2-2 1/2 minutes."
- "They turn out springy and fluffy.  They taste great just like this, but since they&#39;re only slightly sweet, you can top with honey or something if you would like."
