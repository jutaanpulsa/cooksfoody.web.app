recipeinstructions:

Strain excess grease and then add the chorizo to the beef and mix well in pan. Season with a little salt and pepper. Set aside and let cool.

Place back in oven for approximately 20 minutes or until cheese is melted and starting to brown slightly."
- "Remove from oven and let cool before plating."
- "I served them up like nachos with a side of sour cream and garnished with chopped green onions and cilantro. Some other serving suggestions include salsa, black olives, diced avocado, diced tomatoes, or whatever else you might like."
