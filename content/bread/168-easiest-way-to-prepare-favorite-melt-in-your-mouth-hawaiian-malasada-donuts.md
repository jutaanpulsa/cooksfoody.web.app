recipeinstructions:
- "I used this condensed milk, which is canned in a factory in Kumamoto, using domestic milk and sugar from Australia or South America."
- "Put the egg → condensed milk → water in a measuring cup in that order, so that the total comes to 200 ml. Put all the ingredients (except for the sugar and coatings) in a bread machine and start the &#34;dough only&#34; program."
- "Make ready 12 pieces of 10 cm square kitchen parchment paper. When the dough making program is done, divide the dough into 12 portions, round them off and put them on the pieces of paper."
- "(This dough is not rested.) Use your microwave oven&#39;s bread-rising function to let the rise rise for 45 minutes or so at 40°C (2nd rising) until the dough has doubled in volume."
- "Try your best not to touch the dough. As soon as the 2nd rising is done, gently place the dough in oil heated to 170℃, with the squares of paper to prevent it from sticking to your hands."
- "Since this dough is low in moisture, it won&#39;t make any sound or bubble up even in hot oil. But that means it&#39;s doing well, so don&#39;t worry!"
- "Fry on both sides for about 2 minutes each until golden brown. They won&#39;t make a sizzling sound even when you turn them over. But that&#39;s OK!"
- "Put the cooked donuts on a draining rack on their sides to drain off the oil. If you set their top/bottom on the rack, the excess oil won&#39;t drain off properly."
- "Once the oil has drained off, put a malasada while it&#39;s still hot in a plastic bag with granulated sugar one at a time and shake it around to coat with the sugar."
- "Please enjoy these freshly fried! You can warm them up in the microwave for 20 seconds the next day. Try mixing cinnamon powder, powdered coconut, kinako flour and so on in the sugar."
- "You maybe wondering if 100 g of condensed milk is needed, but not to worry. For that unique malasada feel, it&#39;s needed. You can use homemade condensed milk made by simmering soy milk and sugar together."
