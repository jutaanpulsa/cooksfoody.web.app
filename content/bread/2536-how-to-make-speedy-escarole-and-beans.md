recipeinstructions:
- "Begin by cutting a half inch off of the bottom of the escarole, the stem, then chop up the leaves."
- "After that, thoroughly clean the leaves at least 3 times, to get out all of the dirt. Trust me, I did not do this once and although it tasted it great, the grittiness ruined it."
- "Heat a large pot over medium heat, once hot add the olive oil. Slice or dice up some garlic, then add to the pot to brown. You may either keep the garlic in the pot or take it out once it is browned, depending on your preference."
- "Add the escarole to the pot. Depending on how much you have, you may have to divide it up. Let the escarole sweat for a few minutes, then add the rest of the escarole. Once all of the escarole is in the pot, saute the escarole with the lid on the pot. Approximately 10-15 minutes"
- "The escarole will reduce in size. Once it has wilted, remove the lid, add the pepper, oregano, and basil. Let it cook altogether for another 10-15 minutes."
- "At this point, add the two cans of beans, fill the empty cans with water and add the water into the pot. Turn the heat to high."
- "Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to medium high, and then let it boil for 20-30 minutes. Stir occasionally. Here, check the consistency of the beans. If they are done to your preference, then you are done. I will usually let it boil for an additional 20-30 minutes. I like my broth to be a bit thicker than most."
- "Enjoy!"
