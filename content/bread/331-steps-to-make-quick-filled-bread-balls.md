- "2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil or anything else"
- "20 grams of flour to sprinkle on top of the dough"

- "500 grams ground beef"
- "1 onion"
- "1 tbsp of oil"
- "2 to 3 bell peppers"
- "2 tomatoes"
- "1 salt pepper to taste"
- "1 chili flakes  optional"
- "1 little bit of dried or fresh oregano and thyme to taste"
- "300 grams cheese mozzarella gouda mild cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get your bread dough ready, you can literally use any kind of bread dough you like - I love ciabatta bread dough with it, but anything will do, as long as it isn&#39;t sweet. Use about 500 grams / 1 pound / half the package of it, to make a decent amount of those little things! Just put the premixed flour into a bowl and add the required amount of water to it, about lukewarm in order to let the yeast do its job. Knead for a bit, mix well.. to make it less sticky, you might want to add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Other oil would work, however olive oil is the best in my eyes."
- "Now sprinkle some flour over the dough, cover it and let it sit, for about 30-60 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, chop the onion finely, drop the pieces into a pan, add the ground beef and a little oil, and start cooking it. Wait until the ground beef gets a little brown, and cooked through."
- "Remove the stems and seeds of both bell peppers, and cut them into little pieces. Add to the ground beef in the pan. Then cut the tomatoes into small pieces as well, and add to the pan too. Add some salt and pepper, the oregano and thyme - and if you want, some chili flakes to the mix in the pan."
- "Now take about 2 thirds of the cheese and grate it, or cut into small pieces. Add into the pan, and melt completely. You might require more cheese, depending on how much meat and how many vegetables you used. Everything should get a little bit of melted cheese onto it, so don&#39;t be stingy with it! Afterwards, remove pan from heat. Grate the rest of the cheese, and put onto a plate in a reachable spot."
- "Now your dough should be ready. Sprinkle some flour on the table, get the dough out, on top of the flour, and try to shape it into a square, as good as possible. Its just easier to split into the 12 pieces like that. Of course you can also make more and smaller bread balls, just split dough into desired amount. Use a butter knife, or a plastic pizza cutter, or anything to split the dough into the 12 pieces."
- "Start with your first portion of dough. Get some flour on your hands, to not get completely stuck in the dough, maybe some on the spot where you are going to be working at.. Press the dough into a flat shape, as if you were going to make a little pizza. Sprinkle some of your grated cheese on it, and add some of the filling you made before. Then pull on all the sides of the little dough pizza and close it, shaping a little ball out of it. Repeat until all dough is used up! Don&#39;t forget to start preheating your oven at about the time you&#39;re halfway finished with the dough. 220°F Celsius / 430 Fahrenheit are good."
- "Place all your little bread balls onto a oven rack, covered with a greased baking paper, as they might (if your dough got very thin at some point) open up a bit, and spill some of their filling. Bake for about 18-24 minutes, until they start getting a little brown."
