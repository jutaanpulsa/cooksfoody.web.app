recipeingredient:
- "4 large Egg yolk"
- "5 large Egg white"
- "70 grams Light brown sugar or granulated sugar"
- "35 grams Kuromitsu"
- "20 ml Water"
- "40 ml Vegetable oil"
- "70 grams Cake flour"
- "30 grams Kinako"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the cake flour and kinako together into a bowl. Separate the egg yolks and whites. Preheat the oven to 170°C."
- "Add 2/3 of granulated sugar little by little while whipping the egg whites to make a meringue with stiff peaks. Store in the refrigerator."
- "Add the rest of the granulated sugar into the bowl of egg yolks and whip until pale and fluffy. Add the brown sugar syrup, water, and vegetable oil."
- "Then, sift in the flour mixture from Step 1 into the bowl and mix well."
- "Add 1/3 of the meringue from Step 2 and fold. Add another half of the meringue and fold in the batter to mix."
- "Lastly, add the batter into the bowl of meringue and fold gently to avoid breaking the air bubbles. Fold gently from the bottom like using a knife to cut the meringue."
- "Pour the batter into a chiffon mold. Hold the middle of the mold and tap lightly against a flat surface to pop the trapped air bubbles."
- "Bake in the oven at 170°C for about 20 minutes. While baking, make 4-5 incisions with a bread knife (optional)."
- "Lower the oven temperature to 160°C and bake for 10 more minutes (or you can keep it at 170°C). The cake is finished if a poked skewer comes out clean."
- "Cool the cake upside down on a cup. (The cake will fall apart if you try to remove the mold while it&#39;s hot)."
- "Once the cake has cooled, run a palette knife along the side of the mold. Use skewers for the middle part. Drop the cake upside down onto a plate."
- "Garnish and it&#39;s ready to eat. It&#39;s really good if you pour kuromitsu over the dollop of whipped cream."
- "This is the kuromitsu I used. It&#39;s so convenient because I can use it for many dishes. I also used two 15 g packets of kinako."
