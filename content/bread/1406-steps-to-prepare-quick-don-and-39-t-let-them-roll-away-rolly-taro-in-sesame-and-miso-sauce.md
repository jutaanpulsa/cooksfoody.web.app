recipeingredient:
- "10 Taro root or nagaimo"
- "100 ml Water"
- "1 tsp Dashi stock granules"
- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Mirin"
- "1 tbsp Blended miso"
- "2 tbsp Ground sesame or sesame paste"
- "1 tsp katakuriko and 2 teaspoons water Katakuriko slurry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel the taro roots and soak in water for 5 minutes. If they&#39;re organic, simply scrub off the dirt and fibers and leave the skin on."
- "Drain excess water from the taro and place on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave at 800W for 7 minutes. Adjust the cooking time according to the size and amount of the taro and your microwave. Heat until soft enough to pierce with a skewer."
- "While cooking, grind the sesame until it releases oil. If using sesame paste, you can skip this step."
- "Mix together the ● ingredients in a pan, bring to a simmer, then add the mirin, miso, and ground sesame (or paste)."
- "While the sauce is simmering, add the katakuriko dissolved in water, immediately remove from heat and add the microwaved taro. Once the taro root is coated in sauce, it&#39;s ready to go."
- "You can also drizzle the sauce over the taro rather than coating it. Top with sesame seeds or yuzu pepper to taste."
- "The taro roots taste nice and floury without falling apart, and are well seasoned with the sesame and miso flavors. This dish tastes just as good as a slow-cooked one, but takes none of the time."
- "Using frozen taro saves time on having to peel them. If using frozen taro, skip Step 1."
