recipeingredient:
- " Cake batter"

- "60 grams Sugar"
- "50 grams Cake flour"
- "4 Salt preserved sakura leaves"
- " For the sakura syrup"
- "4 tbsp each Sugar water"
- "2 leaves Saltpreserved sakura leaves"
- " For the sakura cream"
- "150 ml Heavy cream"
- "1 tsp Gelatin powder"
- "1 Garnish saltpreserved sakura blossoms"
recipeinstructions:
- "Soak the powdered gelatin in one tablespoon water. Quickly rinse the sakura leaves in water, and dry them off. Place the leavesfor the batter on a paper towel, and microwave for about a minute. Use a mill, etc., to pulverize it into a powder. Sift the flour. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Preheat the oven to 180℃."
- "Sakura Cake Batter: Break an egg into a bowl, and over a hot water bath stir it until it thickens. Add the sugar in three batches, whisking throughly each time. Remove from the hot water temperature when the mixture reaches body temperature. Whisk until the mixture forms ribbons."
- "Add 1 tablespoon water to the mixture and mix. Add the flour and sakura leaf powder in three batches, mixing thoroughly each time. (The cake will have a rough texture if you don&#39;t mix it enough)."
- "Pour the batter into the pan all at once without using a spatula. Use  the last bit of batter in the bowl to fill in the corners of the pan since it will just harden. Lightly tap the pan to remove the air. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, and then let cool after baking."
- "Sakura Syrup: Combine the shredded sakura leaves, water, and sugar in a pot and heat on low. Increase to medium once it reaches a gentle boil. Let boil for several seconds, and then turn off the heat. Remove the sakura leaves from the pot. Remove any hard bits, and finely mince. (I have only used half of the sakura leaves in the photo)."
- "Sakura Cream: Combine heavy cream with 2 tablespoons of the sakura syrup from Step 5 and minced sakura leaves in a bowl, and beat lightly. Take this chance to remove the baked cake from the oven. Dissolve the gelatin in the microwave, place into a bowl, and lightly beat over an ice water bath, chilling it to the point to where it is thick enough to easily spread on the cake."
- "Finishing Touches: Coat the surface of the cake with the sakura syrup from Step 5 and sakura cream from Step 6. Roll it up, chill in the fridge for about an hour, and it is done."
- "Make 3 cuts into the end before rolling it up. Cut the end off one side and use it as the core. Coat the core with syrup and cream as well to make it easier to roll up."
