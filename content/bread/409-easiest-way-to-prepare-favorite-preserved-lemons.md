recipeingredient:
- "1 Organic unwaxed lemons"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Salt per lemon"
- "1/2 tbsp Sugar per lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Since the peel is preserved too, it&#39;s best to use organic, pesticide-free, unwaxed lemons. Wash the lemons well, and cut up in any way you like."
- "Stuff the lemons in a jar with a lid. Add the amount of salt and sugar appropriate for the number of lemons you are preserving. Close the lid and leave the jar out at room temperature."
- "A metal lid will become corroded by the salt, so put a piece of plastic wrap over the jar before closing the lid. Shake the jar by flipping it upside down, back and forth, 1 to 2 times a day for the first few days to distribute the salt. Once the salt has melted, you only need to shake the jar occasionally. The lemons will be ready to use in about 2 weeks, but the longer you can let them mature, the milder their sourness and saltiness will become."
- "When the lemons mature, they&#39;ll turn white and limp. That doesn&#39;t mean they have gone bad, so don&#39;t worry. I have used less salt than is usual, so that the lemons are easy to use as a seasoning ingredient. So try to use them up within 3 months."
