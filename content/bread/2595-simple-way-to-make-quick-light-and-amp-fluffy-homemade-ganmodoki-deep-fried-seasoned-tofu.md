- "Rinse the hijiki seaweed quickly. I used to soak the hijiki seaweed in water, but I realized that they rehydrate by being mixed with the tofu. I just rinse and mix with tofu now."
- "Mash the tofu until smooth with a whisk. Add the ☆ ingredients and mix well. Add all the remaining ingredients and mix well."

- "There is a change to the recipe. I use 500-600 g of tofu and there is actually a big difference in the amount. Accordingly, I changed the amount of the ☆ soy sauce and ☆ salt. If you use 500 g of tofu, use less amount of them (e.g. 1/2 teaspoon of ☆ salt). Increase or reduce the amount of the seasonings according to the amount of the tofu you will use. You don&#39;t have to change the amount of the other ingredients, though."
