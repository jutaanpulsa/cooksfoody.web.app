recipeinstructions:
- "Cut about 2 inches of dough off the end of loaf. Spray counter lightly with non-stick cooking spray and roll the cut off piece into a 9x12-inch oval. Trim two 1x10-inch strips off the oval and set them aside. Place the oval on sprayed baking sheet and shape into a flat football shape."

Let cool and trim out middle of football to make as much space as desired for your dip. Fill with Queso Dip (recipe below). Make stitching by cutting a string cheese and lay on top of dip. Serve with chips."
