Use gloves when chopping those peppers and DON&#39;T touch anything on you body or anyone else&#39;s...trust me on that... Wash your hands with vinegar or lemon juice after chopping the peppers.  I serve these with either red beans or black beans and rice. Finally, if you have extra meat mixture left, it mixes well into the beans or freezes well too.  I created this recipe after having something similar at a local Cajun restaurant...theirs was made with shredded beef and pickled jalapeno peppers, so this is my version."
