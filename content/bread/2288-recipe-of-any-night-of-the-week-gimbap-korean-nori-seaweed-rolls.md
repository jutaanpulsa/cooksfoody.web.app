recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the ○ ingredients into the rice. Alternatively, you can add the sesame oil and salt to the rice before cooking it, and add the sesame seeds to the cooked rice."
- "Make the fillings ready.  You can use whatever you like or have on hand.  I made these with lots of filling. Cut the takuan pickles into 6-7 mm thick slices. Season the eggs with sugar and salt, make tamagoyaki (rolled omelette) and cut into 6 to 7 mm slices."
- "De-seed the cucumber and slice lengthwise thinly. Cut the carrot into about the same size, boil then stir fry in a little oil, and season with a little salt. Blanch the spinach, refresh in cold water, squeeze out well and mix with a little sesame oil and salt."
- "Cut the fish sausage into 6 to 7 mm thick pieces too. (If you&#39;re using crab sticks, split them in half lengthwise.) If you&#39;re using thinly sliced beef chop it up and stir fry it, and season with sugar and soy sauce or yakiniku sauce. You can use ground beef too. Squeeze out the kimchi lightly."
- "Spread a sheet of nori seaweed as thinly as possible with rice. Be sure not to put any rice on the edges, which will overlap."
- "Add the fillings, and roll up fairly loosely."
- "When the rolls are made, brush the surfaces with a little sesame oil. Put some salt on your hands and spread it lightly over the surface too. Sprinkle on some sesame seeds to taste. If possible, keep them wrapped in plastic wrap for a while to allow the rolls to soften and meld."
- "Cut into about 1 cm wide (rather thin) slices and they&#39;re done! Wipe your knife with a moistened kitchen towel while cutting in order to have nice looking slices. (This is a no-kimchi version.)"
- "This is a kimchi version. Kimchi and rice together is sooo good!"
