- "8 large eggs"
- "3 tbsp mayonnaise or miracle whip"
- "1 tbsp milk I use coconut milk"
- "1 tsp relish"
- "1/2 tsp mustard"
- "1 can sliced olives"
- "1 each baby carrot"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil eggs rapidly for 6 minutes, then rinse in cold water. You can use decorated hard-boiled Easter eggs as well-yay recycling!"
- "Peel eggs and rinse to remove any excess pieces of shell."
- "Cut the eggs in half width-wise, the opposite of classic deviled eggs. Remove the hardened yolks and place in a mixing bowl, then shave a small amount off the end of each egg white so that it stands upright."
- "Very carefully, use a paring knife to cut zig-zags around the rim of the eggs."
- "Add mayo, mustard, relish, and milk to the bowl containing the yolks, and mix thoroughly. I used an electric mixture for about 2 minutes for optimum fluffiness! Spoon the yolk mixture into a Ziploc bag, seal tight, and make a small cut in one of the bottom corners. This is more precise than spooning the yolk mixture."
- "Fill &#39;em up!! (Gently squeeze the Ziploc to dispense the yolk mixture into the egg whites.)"
- "Place 2 olive slices on each egg as the chick&#39;s eyes."
- "Slice the baby carrot in half, then using your paring knife again, make zig-zags across the carrot. This makes perfect triangular beaks!"
