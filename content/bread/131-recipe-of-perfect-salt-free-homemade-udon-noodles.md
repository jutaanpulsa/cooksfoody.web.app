recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Allpurpose flour"
- "160 ml Water"
- "1 Flour for dusting allpurpose flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the water to the flour little by little until it forms a rough dough. It&#39;s fine if it looks a bit crumbly."
- "Put the dough in a thick plastic bag and step on the dough until it&#39;s flat. Don&#39;t close the bag up."
- "Take the dough out of the bag and fold into thirds. Return the dough to the bag and step on it again until it&#39;s flat. Repeat this procedure 7 to 10 times."
- "Turn the dough one quarter every time you fold it over. Eventually you will end up with a smooth, square piece of dough."
- "Cover the dough with a tightly wrung out kitchen towel, and let rest for 40 minutes."
- "Dust the work surface and the dough with flour. Flatten first with your hands, then roll out with a rolling pin. When the dough is 30 cm square,"
- "..flour it again and roll it around the rolling pin.  Roll the dough putting your weight into it, rolling from front to back and side to side."
- "When the dough is about 3mm thick, spread it out and fold it up accordion-style into 10cm wide folds, then cut the dough."
- "Cut the noodles rather thinly, since they&#39;ll become about 20% thicker after you boil them. The noodles in the photo increased in thickness from 5.4mm to 6.6mm."
- "Dust the noodles and untangle them."
- "Put the noodles in plenty of boiling water, stirring with cooking chopsticks to prevent them from sticking together."
- "When the water comes back to a boil, lower the heat so that the pot doesn&#39;t boil over. Boil for about 12 minutes."
- "When the noodles are done, drain and then rinse the noodles in cold running water while scrubbing the noodles gently with your hands. This makes the noodles firm and shiny."
