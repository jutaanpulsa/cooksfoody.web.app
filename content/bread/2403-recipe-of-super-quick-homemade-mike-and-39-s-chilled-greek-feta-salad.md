recipeingredient:
- " Greek Feta Salad"
- "1 box (12 oz) Multi Colored Rotini Pasta"
- "2 (8 oz) Boxes ATHENOS Feta Cheese Chunks 14 chop"
- "5 oz Shreadded Parmesan Cheese"
- "1/4 Cup Sun Dried Tomatoes in oil  chopped"
- "1 can Artichokes In Water drained  chopped"
- "1/2 large Red  Green  Yellow  Orange Bell Pepper chopped"
- "1 can Black Olives drained  sliced in half"
- "1 large Cucumber peeled  chopped"
- "1 (10.5 oz) Cherry Tomatoes sliced in half"
- "1/2 cup Chopped Green Onions"
- "1 Purple Onion chopped"
- "1/2 Bunch Fresh Parsley rough chop"
- "1 Fresh Cracked Black Pepper to taste"
- "2 tbsp Fresh Basil optional"
- "1 cup Banana Peppers optional"
- "2 (16 oz) Bottles Kraft Zesty Italian Dressing reserve one bottle"
recipeinstructions:
- "Clean, chop and drain all vegetables. Refrigerate until pasta is ready and cooled down."
- "Chop Feta Cheese chunks in semi large chunks and add to vegetables. They will fall apart slightly when mixed with the dressing."
- "Shred Parmesan Cheese if not already shreadded."
- "Bring a large pot of water to a steady boil and add 1/2 tsp salt and a splash of oil.  Pour pasta into boiling water, stirring occasionally and cover for 8 minutes. Or, as per box directions. I&#39;ll boil my noodles al dente [just under manufacturers directions] for a toothier chew."
- "Drain noodles and place pasta in a large bowl.  Immediately add your entire bottle of Italian Dressing to your pasta and mix well.   This step is important. Especially if you&#39;re serving this dish the same day. Your pasta will instantly begin to absorb your dressing while hot.  Allow pasta to cool naturally on the counter."
- "Also another great dressing option!"
- "After pasta has cooled off - add all of your chopped chilled vegetables and cheeses. Gently fold them in.  Refrigerate salad for several hours - gently mixing occasionally.  As needed - add your reserved bottle of dressing if you feel your salad is firming up too much with the addition of cheese."
- "Authors Notes:   #1: I&#39;ve tried the most expensive Italian Dressings and most of the more cost effective ones. One of the best I&#39;ve found to date is Kraft Zesty Italian for flavor and price.   #2: The flavor of this salad is exponentially better the following day.   #3: Stir entire batch of salad from the base upwards each time before serving dishes for best flavor.  Enjoy!"
