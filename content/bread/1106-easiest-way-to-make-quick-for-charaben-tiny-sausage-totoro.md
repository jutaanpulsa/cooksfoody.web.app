recipeingredient:
- "1 Tiny round wiener sausage"
- "1 Nori seaweed"
- "1 Sliced cheese"
- "1 piece Snacking kombu"
- "1 Spaghetti strand"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the wiener sausage in half."
- "Hold it upright and make a slit on the top."
- "Push a round cutter about 5 mm into the bottom of the sausage."
- "Carve out the part where you pressed in the cutter rather deeply. The carved out part will be covered so it can be rough."
- "Cut out the face from the sliced cheese using the same cutter."
- "Fix the cheese into the circle in the sausage."
- "Cut the part you cut out of the sausage with scissors to make the ears."
- "Stick the ears into the slit you made in Step 1, and secure them from the back with a piece of spaghetti."
- "Cut small circles out of the sliced cheese to make the eyes. If you use the cheese as-is, the eyes will look like they are sticking out, so you may want to slice it in half before punching out the circles to make it very thin."
- "Stick the cheese eyes from Step 9 on the sausage, and affix them with spaghetti strands. If you dig out a bit of the sausage as you did with the tummy, it&#39;s less likely to fall apart."
- "Make the facial feature parts from nori using the nori punchers, and stick them on the face. Use a tiny bit of mayonnaise as &#34;glue.&#34;"
- "Cut the snacking kombu very thinly with scissors to make the whiskers."
- "Poke holes in the face before you poke the cut kombu for the whiskers. It&#39;s easy that way."
- ""
- "Put the nori patterns on the tummy to finish."
