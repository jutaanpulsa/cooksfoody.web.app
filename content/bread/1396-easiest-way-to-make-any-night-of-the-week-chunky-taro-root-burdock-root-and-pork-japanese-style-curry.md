recipeingredient:
- "400 grams Thinly sliced pork"
- "14 Taro root"
- "2 Washed burdock root about 40 cm"
- "1 Carrot"
- "2 medium Onion"
- "3 Fresh shiitake mushrooms"
- "1 packet Shimeji mushrooms"
- "2 tbsp Sesame oil"
- "1 packages Medium spicy curry roux"
- "1200 ml Water or kombu based dashi stock"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the taro potatoes well, peel with a peeler, and leave round. Cut the washed burdock root into chunks and place in water. Cut the carrots and onions into large chunks, and break apart the shimeji and fresh shiitake mushrooms by hand."
- "Heat up a pot, sauté the pork first in the sesame oil, and then the onions and carrots."
- "Add in the water-soaked burdock root and taro potatoes and sauté, adding in the mushrooms as well."
- "Add in water, bring to a boil, and cleanly skim out the scum. This is a Japanese-style curry, so you can use broth from something you cooked the other day to make a good soup stock. This time, I used 700ml of broth and 500ml of water. Cover with a lid and boil over a low heat for 20 minutes."
- "It&#39;s good to go if the taro potatoes aren&#39;t falling apart, and you can cleanly stick them with a toothpick. Dissolve the roux, simmer for about 10 minutes, and it&#39;s done."
