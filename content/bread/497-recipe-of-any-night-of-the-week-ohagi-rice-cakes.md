- "Cook the rice. If you don&#39;t have a rice cooker, you can use a normal pot and an oven or a microwave. If you use a pot, put a lid and heat it until boiling. Then lower the heat and cook for about 15 minutes. Stop heating and leave it for 10 minutes with the lid on.  In case of microwave, put in a microwavable bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 5 minutes, then turn over the rice with a big spoon or spatula, and repeat it again. After the last 5-min microwave, leave the bowl in the oven (with the plastic wrap on) for 10 minutes."

- "(&#34;Half-killed&#34; sticky rice)"
- "Prepare the bean jam and the kinako. Microwave the bean jam if it is too wet (be careful, it will be very hot and you may burn your hands. Cool it down). Mix the kinako powder with sugar in a bowl."
- "Wet your hand (a bowl of water on your side is useful) and take some of the rice in your hand."
- "For Kinako ohagis, spread the rice, put a ball of bean jam and wrap up. Put the rice ball in the bowl of kinako powder."
- "For Anko (bean jam) ohagis, make a rice ball and wrap it with the bean jam."
