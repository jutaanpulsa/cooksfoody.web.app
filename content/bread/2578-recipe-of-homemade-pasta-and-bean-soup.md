Simmer until the soup thickens and is creamy and flavorful, about. Essentially a chicken broth soup with beans and pasta. We&#39;ll use a low-sodium chicken broth next time because the regular chicken broth&#39;s saltiness kept us from tasting the tomatoes and spinach (the latter not being a bad thing!). The spinach really adds color to the soup.
