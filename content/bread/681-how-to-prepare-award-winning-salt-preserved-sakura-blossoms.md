recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Sakura cherry blossoms"
- "40 grams Coarse salt"
- "3 tbsp Rice vinegar"
- "1 Coarse salt for final touches"
recipeinstructions:
- "Choose double flowered cherry blossoms that have bloomed about 70%. Use flowers that haven&#39;t bloomed completely yet. Pick them off the trees from the base of the stems."
- "Wash the flowers. Separate the clumps of flowers apart so that each portion has about 2 blossoms connected by their stems, like cherries."
- "Coat with salt gently on the palms of your hands, so as not to damage the blossoms."
- "Mist the flowers with water, wrap with cling film, and place on a weight about 2 times the total mass of the flowers. Wait at least 2 days. This will help draw any excess moisture and harshness from the flowers."
- "You&#39;re on the right track if your flowers start releasing moisture. Take out the flowers and gently wipe dry with paper towels, etc. (don&#39;t wring them out, just press them dry between sheets of paper towels)."
- "Return the blossoms from Step 5 into the container, add the rice vinegar, place a weight on top and leave the flavors to settle in for at least 2 days. After a while, the flowers will turn a bright pink."
- "Once enough of the color has been extracted, remove the flowers, and pat dry with paper towels... Give one a try. They&#39;re so tasty."
- "Coat with salt."
- "Pack in tupperware or storage containers."
- "This is the vinegar that became infused with the sakura during Step 6. It&#39;s so vibrantly colored and beautiful. I couldn&#39;t let it go to waste, so I used it in the sakura sushi above."
- "It&#39;s great to enjoy as a tea."
