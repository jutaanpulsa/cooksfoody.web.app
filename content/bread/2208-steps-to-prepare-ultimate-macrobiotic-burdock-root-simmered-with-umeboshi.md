recipeingredient:
- "300 grams Burdock root"
- "4 or more Umeboshi pits"
- "1 Kombu seaweed for dashi stock 7 x 10 cm"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse and remove the soil from the outside of the burdock root using a scrub brush or other tool. Do not remove the peel as keeping it will add a pleasant aroma to the dish."
- "Decide on the pot you will use, and cut the burdock root to a size that will easily fit in the pot. Add the burdock, umeboshi pit, kombu, and enough water to cover the ingredients into the pot."
- "If possible, use an otoshibuta (drop lid), otherwise just use a regular lid for the pot."
- "Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the burdock softens. Check the burdock occasionally through this process. Try to simmer off as much of the liquid as possible."
- "I modified the amount of burdock as I found the kind I was buying at the organic supermarket was much smaller than the usual variety."
- "It is very important to make sure the liquid has been cooked off. If the umeboshi don&#39;t have much salt, the dish will be a bit bland, so make sure to add enough pits."
- "Ah, I really did it. I burned the burdock roots black. Nothing to do now but to peel them before eating."
