- "1/2 yellow onion sliced to half rings"
- "3 tbsp sofrito"
- "1 can tomato sauce"
- "1 bay leaf"
- "1 packets sazon goya con cilantro y achiote"
- "1 (3 1/4 oz) bag of chicharrones fried pork skins"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put olive oil, salt, adobo, 1 tbsp oregano, and 2 garlic cloves (minced in a food processor). Chop until well mixed"
- "Put chicken in a ziplock bag with marinade. Let marinade for at least a day up to 12 hours in the refrigerator."
- "Cut a slit in the skin of the plantain. Try not to cut into the fruit."
- "Pull back the peel from the slit."
- "Cut off the ends and discard. Then cut the slices at an angle about 3/4&#34; thick."
- "Repeat this for the other plantains. Fully submerge in salt water (salt to about the taste of ocean water). Place in the fridge to soak"
- "Start to brown the chicken in batches in a dutch oven over medium heat. Do not crowd the pan or you wont achieve browning, you&#39;ll actually end up steaming the chicken. Remove the chicken as its brown to a bowl."
- "Lower the heat to medium. In the same pot cook your onions and garlic till aromatic (about 3-5 minutes)."
- "Add one cup water and scrape as much if the frond as you can off the bottom of the pan. Simmer for two minutes"
- "Add sofrito, tomato sauce, sazon,  water, better than boullion or equivalent, celery, potatoes, carrots, bay leaf and cilantro. Cook for five minutes"
- "Simmer for 10 minutes over medium-high heat."
- "Add chicken and then simmer for another 20 minutes. Season to taste with adobo and/salt. All done! Cover and put this to the side. Its time too make the mofongo."
- "Bring a medium sauce pan filled with water to boil."
- "When the water comes to a boil place the 1/2 of your plantains in the boiling water. Set timer for ten minutes. You&#39;ll want to remove the plantains when they can be pierced by a fork."
- "While waiting for the water to boil, lay the other 1/2 of your soaked plantains out on paper towels and put another one over them to pat them dry. Try to get them really dry. These will be going into hot oil pretty soon, dont want splatter all over your arms."
- "Pour enough oil to make a 1 inch thick pool on the bottom of a hot sautee pan over medium heat. Let it heat up until you can feel the heat when you hold your hand about 6 inches away. Another way to test the oil is put a tiny piece of plantain in the oil. If it starts to cook immediately youre ready. While waiting you can line a large plate with paper towels to absorb the extra oil from the cooked plantains."
- "You can also mash the remaining minced garlic in a mortar and pestle"
- "And crush your chicharrones in a large bowl."
- "Using a spider (basically a wire mesh spoon) place the plantains in the hot oil. Allow to brown and then move to the paper towel lined plate."
- "To help your mixing efforts, go ahead and chop up the fried plantains."
- "Then combine the garlic, chicharrones and plantains (fried and boiled) in a bowl. Mash with a potatoe masher until you get a very stiff dough. Depending on how done you&#39;re plantains are you may need a food processor to help you out, don&#39;t be shy."
- "Work the dough with your hands to make a volcano looking bowl on your plate. The mofongo is very crumbly so it&#39;s easiest to form the walls in your hands and then place them down next to the previous section. Be patient!"
- "Pour in stew garnish and eat up."
