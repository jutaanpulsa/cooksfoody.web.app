recipeingredient:
- "1 raw rice  1 12 rice cooker cup  Sticky rice"
- "1 raw rice  12 rice cooker cup  Plain rice"
- "1 tsp Sugar"
- "50 ml Salt water"
- " Red bean ohagi"
- "400 grams Powdered koshian"
- "120 grams Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- " Kinako ohagi"
- "3 tbsp Kinako"
- "3 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the sticky and plain rice together."
- "Let soak in water for 1 hour."
- "Once it&#39;s done soaking, move the rice to a rice cooker bowl, stir in the sugar, and fill water to the &#34;white rice&#34; line. Adding sugar prevents the sticky rice from becoming too hard."
- "While the rice is cooking, prepare the anko. I used this particular powdered koshi-an this time."
- "Combine the anko with the amount of water indicated on the package, add sugar, and heat. It will be fairly gooey at first."
- "Cook until it&#39;s the desired thickness."
- "Now prepare the kinako. The kinako-sugar ratio is 1:1, so prepare as much as you like to make. I made 3 tablespoons this time."
- "Once the rice is finished, let steam for 10 minutes. Dip a rolling pin or similar rod damped with salt water to slightly mash the rice."
- "Moisten a paper towel and wring out excess water. If you don&#39;t have paper towels, use cling wrap or a tightly wrung towel."
- "Spread bean paste on the paper towel and place the rice on top. Grab enough rice for one ohagi from the rice cooker and cover the rest when not in use."
- "You can eyeball the amount of bean paste and rice. It should look something like this."
- "Use your fingers to gently stretch the bean paste completely around the rice."
- "If the paper towel gets particularly dirty, wash, wring it out, and use it again."
- "Since the kinako is just for sprinkling on the outside of the ohagi, they will end up slightly smaller than the ones wrapped in bean paste, so add a bit more rice to make the sizes similar."
- "Wrap extra ohagi in cling wrap to prevent drying and freeze."
- "These are covered in kinako, but when you defrost the ohagi, the kinako tends to melt, so I recommend defrosting first, then covering with kinako."
