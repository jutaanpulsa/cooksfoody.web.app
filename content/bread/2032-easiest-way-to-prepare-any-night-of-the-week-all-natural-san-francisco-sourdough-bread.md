recipeingredient:
- " Phase One"
- "1/2 cup whole wheat flour"
- "1/2 cup water"
- " Phase two"
- "200 g water"
- "120 g sourdough starter"
- "236 g whole wheat flour"
- " Phase Three"
- "400 g Whole Wheat flour"
- "100 g Buckwheat Flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine Phase One ingredients in a mason jar or a small dish. You need to leave a little room at the top for it to expand. Stir up this flour goo and set it aside in a warm place."
- "Over the next few days, this goo should start to bubble a little. Just check in every so often and see what it looks like. If it starts to bubble, or if it separates, with a layer of kinda gross looking water at the top, add a little more flour and water and stir it up again. Some sources recommend feeding every 12 hours, and I guess this is ideal. But that type of setup stresses me out, so I just feed it when it looks hungry."
- "Depending on where you live, within a week or so (in San Francisco it can happen in a few days, but we&#39;re obviously known for our sourdough) you should find that, when you add flour and water to the mix, it can almost double in volume within a couple of hours. This means your starter is ready to go!"
- "Now, to make a loaf of bread, you combine Phase Two ingredients in a large bowl. Mix well. Cover with a kitchen towel and wait for about 12 hours. I like to do this in the evening so I can do the next step when I wake up in the morning. Once you have your dough fermented, continue with step 7. The next 2 steps are just some pointers on maintaining a natural starter."
- "Any remaining starter from mixing your dough can be kept alive with a fresh helping of flour and water mix. Also, at any point in this process before you bake your bread, the dough should contain some of the yeast you&#39;ve captured in your starter. That means you can always save some portion of this dough as a future starter. Give it away to friends or use it to replenish your own stash. Just feed it regularly, every couple of days or so."
- "If you won&#39;t be using your starter for awhile, you can put it in the fridge. In this case, you only need to feed it maybe once a week. For more long term storage, wait until it&#39;s particularly bubbly and active, then spread it out on a sheet of parchment and let it dry to a crisp. Then, break up the chunks and store in a dark, airtight location. When you want to use it, just mix some of these flakes with some flour and water paste again and wait until it wakes up."
- "So, continuing with step 4 above, just combine the ingredients listed in Phase Three with your fermented dough. Knead them together until you have a nice ball of dough. Put this in a bowl, cover it with plastic, and let it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Note: Feel free to experiment with different flours. I used a combo of these two because I had them in my kitchen."
- "When the 24 hours is up, take your fermented dough out of the fridge. Knead it just a bit to form it into a smooth ball. Pinch the seams together gently to seal them up. Set your dough ball in a warm spot with a towel over it and just let it be for about 5 hours or so. Feel free to use any other kinds of fancy bread-shaping techniques here if you know them."
- "Time to bake. Heat your oven to about 450f. On the top rack, a pizza stone is ideal. On the bottom rack, a cast iron pan or an oven-proof pan you don&#39;t really care about."
- "Give your loaf a light dusting of flour, slice into the top about 1/4&#34; in a few spots so that steam will escape as it bakes, and slide it onto the hot stone. Carefully pour a cup or so of water into the pan on the bottom rack and shut the oven door. Bake for about 45 minutes. When done, your bread should give a hollow knock when thumped."
