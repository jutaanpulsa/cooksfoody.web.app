recipeinstructions:
- "For usal : combine both the types of peas, wash and soak in water for at least 5-6 hours. Discard water and transfer them into a pressure cooker along with a glass of water, salt and soda. Cook it till 2-3 heavy boils. Then close the cooker and cook on low heat for 5 minutes. Now increase the heat to medium high and wait for 4 whistles. This is how the peas should look after cooking."
- "Dry roast cinnamon, cardemom, jeera, black pepper and cloves in a pan on very low flame till they release aroma. Keep aside. Now dry roast dessicated coconut on very low heat, while stirring constantly till it is light pink and crunchy. Upon cooling down, combine them all and grind to fine powder."
- "Heat oil in a thick bottom pan and add onion. Saute till the onion burns out all it&#39;s moisture and starts to look brown (more on darker side) as shown in pic 2. Add the powder spice prepared in step 2 along with dhanajeera powder, chilli powder, turmeric powder, salt and Sevusal masala. Combine well"
- "Then add 1-2 tbsp water in order to allow the spices to cook. Cook till oil separates completely and then add the tomato. Combine well and again cook till oil separates. Then add boiled peas along with the water. Add more water to get very thin consistency. There should be only 35-40% peas and the rest water in Sevusal. Make smooth slurry of chana flour by adding 3 tbsp water in it. Add it in the boiling usal along with lemon juice. Boil on low heat for 5-10 min or until the right consistancy."
- "For Tali: heat oil in a pan. Fry garlic a bit and then add tomato paste, salt and chilli. Fry till oil starts to separate. Add 1/2 cup of water and a tsp sugar. Cook till oil starts to float."
- "To serve : combine onions, coriendar leaves and sev in a plate. Take out a portion of usal in a serving bowl, top it up with desired amount of tali and the sev mixure. Squeeze some lemon over it. Serve it hot with buns."
- "The charges for sevusal includes usal, tali, lemon wedges and a mixure of sev-onions- all unlimited. Buns are charged extra. That&#39;s why they place a jug full of usal, a bowl full of tali, a plate of mixure and an entire packet of buns at our table. One has to combine all that as per the taste and eat with buns. Chilled chhash goes very well with this lipsmakingly hot dish."
- "Tips :1. for best results use grated onion tomato for usal. Grinded paste or chopped versions will not do. 2. There must be only 35-40% Peas and the rest curry in usal. 3. Usal is not supposed to be thick like curry in a sabzi."
