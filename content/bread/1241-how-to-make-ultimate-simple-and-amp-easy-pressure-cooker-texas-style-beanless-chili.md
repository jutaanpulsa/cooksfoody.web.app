recipeinstructions:
- "In a skillet, brown the ground beef 1 pound at a time. Drain fat and place beef into cooker. Trim fat off the roast and cut into 1/2 inch cubes and add to cooker. Add broth and chili seasonings, then mix. Set pressure cooker for 25 mins. When done, release pressure, add Rotel &amp; onions and set timer for 5 mins.
