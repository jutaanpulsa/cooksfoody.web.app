recipeingredient:
- "2 cups All purpose flour"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
- "1 tbsp Oil"
- "1 cup Warm milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Knead a smooth dough out of all the ingredients mentioned. Cover and keep aside for half an hour. This is important. Use more of milk if needed because the quality of flour varies."
- "Take an iron kadai if you have it at home. Otherwise, a nonstick one can also be used. Heat it on a low at first and then invert it on the stove. Divide the flour into small balls of equal size."
- "Roll a very thin roti out of each. Roast it on the inverted kadai until light brown spots are seen. Roast with the help of a clean kitchen cloth. Fold and stack up neatly in a casserole to keep them warm and soft."
- "Serve with any side dish of your choice. A lovely melt in mouth roti that is famous in India. There is actually no match to the one bought from our roadside dhabas and eateries, but this recipe of mine comes close to the original. This was my first try at making these and I have never looked back since. The name translates to a handkerchief in English because of the method of it&#39;s folding and stacking up. Happy Roasting Friends!"
