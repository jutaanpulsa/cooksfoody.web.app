- ".....then flip it around and do it again."
- "As you fill the manicotti, add them to your baking dish until you are packed in. (I can usually fit all but one- don&#39;t squeeze them in or they will be impossible to get out when done)"
- "Top with remaining salsa mixture."
- "Cover with foil and bake at 350* for 30 mins"
- "Remove the foil and now add the rest of your cheeses (1/2 C of cheddar and 1/2 C of monterey jack) and bake for another 10 mins or until cheese is melted (or browned like a real person eats it)"
- "This is the beauty of the entire pan."
