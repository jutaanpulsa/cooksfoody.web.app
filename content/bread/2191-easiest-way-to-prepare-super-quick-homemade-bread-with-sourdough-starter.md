recipeinstructions:

Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, bread with sourdough starter. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Bread with sourdough starter is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It's easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. They are nice and they look fantastic. Bread with sourdough starter is something which I have loved my entire life.

But where does the path to sourdough bread begin? Right in your own kitchen, with your own homemade sourdough starter. The method you&#39;ll read here for making sourdough starter isn&#39;t an exact match for the one you read on another site, or in a cookbook, or in your great-grandma&#39;s diary. It needs a medium, a sourdough starter, in order to be useful to bakers.


To begin with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few ingredients. You can have bread with sourdough starter using 6 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to make Bread with sourdough starter:

1. Take 1 part warm water
1. Get 3 parts flour (more or less)
1. Make ready  salt (1 tsp per 500 g flour)
1. Get  honey (1 tsp per 500 g flour)
1. Make ready  sourdough starter

Instead, it&#39;s made with a live fermented culture, a sourdough starter, which acts as a natural leavening agent. Sourdough is known for its characteristic tangy flavor, chewy texture. I created my sourdough starter years ago, and it&#39;s the same one I use to this day. It&#39;s a spoiled brat now, to be sure, but in exchange for my attention and flour, it stays on schedule.

You can find long and elaborate articles on how to make your own starter while using things like pineapple and grapes.
