- "If you want to keep track of activity, since it&#39;s best used when active to make bread, pop a post it on container to mark the top of the mixture. You can then easily see if it has grown in size."
- "If you want to wait before the next feeding, for example if you run out of flour, just pop it in the fridge."
- "Keep maintaining it this way and it will last a very long time. Just use what you need in the recipe. If however you notice any black spots, this is mould and you need to throw it away and start over. This hasn&#39;t happened to me so far."
