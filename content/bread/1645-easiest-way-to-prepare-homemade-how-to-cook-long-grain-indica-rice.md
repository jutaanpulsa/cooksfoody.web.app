recipeingredient:
- "1 Long grain rice from Thailand Pakistan etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring water to a boil in a pot with a lid. Use lots of water in relation to the rice. When the water comes to a boil, put in the rice. Since the water will be drained off, there&#39;s no need to rinse the rice."
- "Boil for 7 to 8 minutes while stirring occassionally. Stop cooking while the rice still has a bit of a core. Drain the rice into a colander, then return it to the pot."
- "I just drain off the water while holding the rice back with the lid since I want to cut corners. Turn the heat on again and set it to low, and stir the rice so as to evaporate the moisture on it. When you hear popping sounds from the pot turn off the heat."
- "Put the lid on the pot and leave it to steam for 5 to 10 minutes. You don&#39;t have to measure out the rice! This method is great since you can cook just the amount you need, even a small amount."
- "All long grain rice types have different water and time requirements if you cook them in a rice cooker. But with this boiling method you don&#39;t have to worry about the amount of water needed, so it&#39;s ultra-easy."
