recipeingredient:
- "1 Fish sausage"
- "1 Thick tamagoyaki"
- "1 Kamaboko"
- "1 Try other ingredients too"
- "1 Regular sized straw"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the fish sausage 1 cm thick."
- "Cut off all 4 sides to square it off. The square should be about the size of a caramel candy."
- "Make 4 holes with the straw."
- "Insert the round bits you cut out of the sausage into the holes, about 2/3 of the way on. (The photo shows 2 holes plugged back in.) Fill all 4 holes...and it&#39;s done."
- "Kamaboko version:  Cut out a block about the size of a caramel candy.  Kamaboko is firmer than fish sausage so you may have some trouble with the cutouts, but they&#39;ll come out if you push them up from the back."
- "Thick tamagoyaki version:  These were more difficult since they tended to fall apart. But they&#39;re so cute!"
- "Carrot version:  Cook a 1 cm thick slice of carrot in water + sugar syrup to cover (microwave for a bit less than 2 minutes at 500 W), then proceed."
- "This version is made from processed cheese. It was easier to make them with room temperature cheese. You can make a 3-knob block or a 6 knob block, depending on the size of the cheese."
