recipeingredient:
- " For the sakura ganache"
- "100 grams White chocolate"
- "40 grams Heavy cream"
- "50 grams Sakura an"
- "1 leaf Sakura leaf"
- "1 tsp Sakura syrup or liqueur"
- "1 dash Pink food coloring"
- " For the coating"
- "100 grams White chocolate"
- "1 tsp Freeze dried sakura blossoms if not available refer to step 12"
- "1 dash Pink food coloring"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the sakura leaf in water and dry with a paper towel. Mince very finely. Remove the core part."
- "Melt and mix the white chocolate and heavy cream in a bowl suspended over hot water. Then add the sakura an and the sakura leaf and mix."
- "Next add a little of the sakura syrup and pink food coloring. Keep adding until you reach your desired color."
- "Line a baking tray with parchment paper and pour the mixture in. The photo shows the tray lined with plastic wrap, but this breaks easily so I recommend using parchment paper."
- "Leave to cool in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes. Once it has reached the consistency where you are able to gather it together with a spoon, scoop it out into 12 parts. Line up and cool again for 10 minutes."
- "Once they have become firm, quickly round them into balls with your hands and line them up on a piece of parchment paper. Leave to cool once again for 10 minutes."
- "While they are cooling, melt the chocolate used for the coating over a bowl suspended over hot water. Add the freeze dried sakura blossoms and mix."
- "Once the balls in Step 6 have become firm, add each ball to the mixture in Step 7 and cover them with the chocolate with a spoon. Remove the balls with a fork and remove the excess chocolate back into the bowl."
- "Softly place them onto parchment paper. If the temperature of the chocolate is too high, the ganache will quickly melt, so watch out! Do it as fast as you can!"
- "Leave them to cool once again. Add the pink food coloring to the remaining chocolate and insert into a piping bag. Pipe onto the chocolates."
- "Once they are cooled and firm you&#39;re finished! Inside is the soft, cute, pink ganache. The flavor of the sakura is great."
- "You can make a substitute for the freeze dried sakura blossoms. Soak salted pickled sakura blossoms in water to remove the salt. Then remove the moisture with a paper towel. Heat them in a microwave to dry them out and break the petals in to very small pieces."
