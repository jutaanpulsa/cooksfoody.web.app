- "6 muffins Basic ingredients"
- "90 grams Unsalted butter"
- "70 grams Brown Sugar powdered"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "2 Eggs"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "10 grams Corn starch"
- "1/2 tsp Baking powder"
- "1 Rum walnuts raisins etc as desired"
- "1 Step 9 Brown Sugar Coffee Version"
- "1 tsp Instant coffee"
- "1 tsp Milk or rum"
recipeinstructions:
- "[Preparation] Add the butter to a bowl and leave to warm to room temperature. Sift the dry ingredients marked ◎. Bring the egg to room temperature as well. Preheat the oven to 180℃."
- "Cream the butter and add the sugar in 2-3 batches, mixing well after each addition. Add salt and keep mixing until it becomes soft and light."
- "Add a well beaten egg in 2-3 batches. If you blend the butter and sugar properly and add the egg a little at a time whilst continuing to mix, the mixture should look like brown sugar butter cream, as in the photo."
- "Sift in the dry ingredients marked ◎ in 2 - 3 separate batches and gently fold into the mixture with a rubber spatula."
- "Pour the mixture into muffin cups 80% full and top with whatever you like, such as nuts, etc. Bake in a preheated oven for 15 minutes. You may need to adjust the baking time slightly depending on your oven and muffin cups."
- "Check to see if they&#39;re done by inserting a skewer into the center of the muffin. If no raw batter sticks to the skewer, then they&#39;re ready. This is optional, but if you like they&#39;ll taste amazing brushed with rum whilst still hot. Leave to cool before wrapping with cling film and chilling further."
- "[Basic Variation] I mixed raisins into these muffins. For 3 muffins, use about 10 g raisins. Add the raisins to the sifted ingredients in Step 4 and fold into the mixture. If you add the raisins after the sifted ingredients they won&#39;t sink to the bottom."
- "[Brown Sugar Coffee Version] Mix the ingredients marked ☆ together and mix into the main batter after sifting in 1/4 of the dry ingredients. You should mix here and fold in afterwards. The rest of the recipe is the same as written above."
- "[Brown Sugar Coffee Version Extra] I think peanuts go really well as a topping for this. Shredded coconut also goes well but you can add what you like."
- "[Comparing molds] I tried baking these in 6 x 2 cm madeleine cups as well. You can make about 10 madeleines. I baked them for 10 minutes but as they&#39;re made of paper and quite thin, so I did have to adjust the baking time slightly. The brown sugar coffee version should make around the same amount of cupcakes too."
