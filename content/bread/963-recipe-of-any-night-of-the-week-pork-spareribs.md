- "Combine pepper with salt, sugar, chili, and ground allspice, cumin, and coriander. This is your pork rib rub. Mix it up and give it a taste. It should taste pretty good. I like the flavor of the organic cane sugar for this, but any sugar is fine, just probably wanna use a little less."

- "Place the rack in the oven and roast for 2 hours."
- "Towards the end of the oven time, get the smoker heated to around 200f."
- "Move the ribs to your smoker, but pour the drippings into a saucepan first."
- "To the saucepan, add honey, mustard, and banana ketchup (regular ketchup is fine too). Simmer to incorporate and thicken slightly. Use this to baste the ribs every so often for the next couple of hours."
- "You can smoke these for as long as you deem necessary. I&#39;m happy with about 2 hours. When you&#39;re ready, toss em on a cutting board, split em up, and share with friends."
