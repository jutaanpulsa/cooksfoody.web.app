- "Cut pork into bite size pcs. In this I combined a pork chop cut and belly cut. The fat part makes the dish tastier.   Add pork slices to the wok. Season with crushed black pepper to your liking.

Reduce the liquid that seeped out from the veggies or until veggies are cooked.  Add your chili as desired. My mom can&#39;t take the heat so I just added a single long chili, unsliced. Slice the chili is you want heat.  Add salt according to your taste. If you used salty shrimp paste, you might not need to. You might need to add a pinch of sugar instead.   Mix well and remember not to over cook the veggies :)   Remove bay leaves. Garnish with chopped green onion. Serve and enjoy."
