recipeingredient:
- "1 Chicken breast"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "2 tsp Juice from grated ginger"
- "1 Katakuriko"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
- "100 ml Dashi stock"
- "2 tbsp each Soy sauce and sugar"
- "1/2 tbsp Sake"
- "5 cm owrth Daikon radish"
- "1 as much to taste of one  Ichimi spice or Sansho pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the skin and excess fat from the chicken, cut into bite-sized strips (as thinly as possible). Thoroughly rub in the • seasoning, and let sit for 15 minutes."
- "Coat Step 1 in katakuriko. Heat up a small amount of oil in a frying pan, and sauté until golden brown on both sides. It will cook through the rest of the way when stewed, so don&#39;t worry about cooking it completely. Turn off the heat momentarily."
- "Add the ◎ ingredients to step 2 and grate the daikon radish in. It is fine to grate it a bit ahead of time, but if you use the same grater to grate the daikon after the grating the ginger, the strong daikon smell will be reduced, which is convenient."
- "Turn the heat back on, and stew on a low heat for about 5 minutes. I think maybe the cooking time will vary if you double the recipe, or depending on the strength of your stovetop burner, so please compare it to the photo after stewing."
- "Transfer to a serving dish, sprinkle with ichimi (or shichimi spice), top with julienned shiso leaves or chopped green scallions if available, and it is done."
- "Daikon radish: I used 200 g. I referred to a nutrition chart for the listed 1/4 daikon radish amount (one medium is about 800 g). You can add it in before or after, but the amount of water will vary according to the daikon, so please make adjustments with sugar and soy sauce if you think it is too thick or too thin."
- "Test 1: I let this dish sit at room temperature (25℃) for 30 minutes. It&#39;s still soft. By the way I researched average room temperature, and it is usually about 23-25℃."
- "Test 2: after letting the residual heat subside, I put it into the fridge for 3 hours. It was still soft!  My theory is because I made it with these amounts and these steps. Reheat it in the microwave if it hardens."
