- "1 cup whole milk"
- "1 cup water"
- "1 Kosher salt to taste"
- "1 Black pepper to taste"
- "1/2 cup Riverview Farms grits"
- "2 oz grated Gouda"
- "1 tbsp unsalted butter"
- " Trout with Oyster Mushrooms and Pecans"
- "16 oz fresh trout filets"
- "1 Kosher salt to taste"
- "1 Black pepper to taste"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "1/4 cup pecan pieces"
- "2 oz oyster mushrooms chopped"
- "1 tbsp butter"
- "1/8 tsp cinnamon ground"
- "1/4 tsp cumin ground"
- "1/10 tsp cayenne"
- "8 each cherry tomatoes halved"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine milk, water, salt, and pepper in a small sauce pot and bring to a simmer, while occasionally stirring, over medium heat. Slowly stir in the grits with a whisk, then continue to stir until they return to a simmer."
- "Lower heat to medium-low and cook 25-30 minutes. Season the trout with salt and pepper."
- "Continue stirring grits along the bottom of the pot every 5 minutes or so with a whisk and/or flat-edged wooden spoon to avoid scorching the pot. Once grits have cooked fully, turn off the heat, cover the pot and let rest on the stove for another 15-20 minutes."
- "While grits are resting, heat a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add oil, and heat until shimmering."
- "Add trout skin-side down. Cook without turning or moving until the fish is mostly cooked through and well-browned and crisp on the skin side. Move to a plate, skin-side up, and set aside."
- "Add pecans to the trout pan and toast/brown for 1-2 minutes. Add oyster mushrooms, butter, and spices. Cook while stirring 3-4 minutes, or until tender. Add tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Push everything to one side, then return fish to the pan, skin-side up. Turn off the heat."
- "Add the grated Gouda and butter to the grits, stirring well to melt and combine, then adjust the consistency with a little more milk or water if needed. The grits should be viscous but should still “stand up” on the plate."
- "Top trout with the oyster mushroom and pecan mixture and serve alongside a helping of Gouda grits. Enjoy!"
