recipeingredient:
- "4 c water"
- "4 pcs chicken parts bone skin on"
- "1 red onion sliced"
- "3 bay leaves"
- "4 garlic cloves crushed"
- "1 thumb of ginger sliced thinly"
- "1/4 of a Chicken bullion or broth cube"
- "1 stalk Leeks sliced crosswise including dark green part"
- "4 kinds of leafy green vegetables bok choy pechay Chinese cabbage celery leaves etc"
- "to taste Salt  pepper"
- " few leaves of Cilantro for garnish optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine first 7 ingredients together in a pot over medium heat.  Drop in leeks once you see bubbles starting.  Let it boil for 30 to 40 minutes, depending how large your chicken pieces are."
- "When chicken is cooked, drop in all of your sliced leafy greens before you take out the chicken.  Cook until veggies are done, about 7-10 minutes.  Remove chicken if you&#39;re using it for another dish. If it&#39;s only poaching, you need to remove chicken earlier, especially if cooking breasts.  I like using bones in and skin on because it makes the broth tastier, cooking it longer too to get the flavour.  Do a taste test before turning off heat, add salt or pepper or more broth powder as desired.  Serve as a side soup or entree while hot. Garnish with cilantro, leaves only (optional)."
