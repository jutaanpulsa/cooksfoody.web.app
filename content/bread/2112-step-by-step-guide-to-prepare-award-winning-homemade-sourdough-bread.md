recipeinstructions:

- "Make sure you have plenty of flour on top between your tea towel and your dough otherwise you won‚Äôt be able to turn it out as the tea towel will stick with your dough. Leave it to prove for 2-3 hours. At this point you can leave this the the fridge over night and take it out in the morning ready to bake."
- "One your dough have been rested, take them out and use a sharp knife score 3 or 4 tkme on the top of the loaf (a very traditional way)"
- "Preheat the oven to 230 c or gas 8. Put a few ice cubes or cold water into a baking tin and place in the bottom of the oven to create steam. Turn your loaves out onto a baking tray. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until a good crust formed and the loaves sound hollow when you tapped on the base."
- "Leave it to cool down completely before you cut it. I am so proud of my first homemade sourdough üòäüêæüçû"
