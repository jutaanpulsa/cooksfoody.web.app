recipeingredient:
- "3 cups allpurpose flour"
- "1 1/2 teaspoons salt"
- "1/4 teaspoon yeast"
- "1 1/2 cups water"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, and yeast together."
- "Add in water and mix until flour is incorporated. The dough will be stiff. Mix thoroughly - if the dough is too wet, add a little more flour and if there is too much flour, add a little water"
- "Cover the bowl and let rest for 12-18 hours at about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The dough is ready when it is dotted with bubbles. (Longer time may be needed for cooler weather)"
- "After the rest, place dough on a lightly flour-sprinkled surface. Create a surface tension by folding the dough over itself about 4-8 times or until tight."
- "Spray a bowl with cooking spray and place dough into the bowl and cover. Let it rise for 2 hours. When the dough is ready, it will have doubled in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger"
- "At least 30 minutes before the dough is ready, heat the oven to 450 degrees. Place your 6-8 quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, pyrex, or ceramic) in the oven while it heats"
- "When the pot has been heated and the dough is ready, carefully place the dough into the pot, seam side up."
- "Cover and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the lid and bake for another 5-10 minutes and bake until the loaf has browned on top."
- "Cool on wire rack before slicing"
