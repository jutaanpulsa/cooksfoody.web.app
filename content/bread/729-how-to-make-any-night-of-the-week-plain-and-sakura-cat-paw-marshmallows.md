recipeingredient:
- " Plain version"
- "1 Egg white"
- "45 grams Sugar"
- "50 ml Water"
- "10 grams Gelatin"
- "1 Corn starch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the sugar in the egg white, and beat well until it forms stiff peaks."
- "For the plain version: Add the gelatin to the water and microwave briefly to dissolve. For the pink version: Add the gelatin to the sakura syrup and microwave briefly."
- "Add the dissolved gelatin from Step 2 to the Step 1 meringue, and mix well. If your kitchen is cold, the mixture will set quickly, so if it starts to stiffen too fast, mix it over a bowl of hot water."

- "Add food coloring to the remaining third of the mixture, and put into another piping bag."
- "Line a tray with plastic wrap. Pipe out the Step 4 white mixture into circles over the plastic wrap, then pipe out smaller rounds onto the white ones with the colored Step 5 mixture so that they look like paws."
- "In the winter, the marshmallows will set in about 30 minutes. Once they have set, remove the plastic wrap, dust with cornstarch and they&#39;re done."
