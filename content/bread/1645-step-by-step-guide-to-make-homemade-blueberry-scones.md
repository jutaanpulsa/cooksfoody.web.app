- " Dough"
- "260 g flour"
- "1 tbsp baking powder"
- "2 tbsp brown sugar"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "72 g butter cold cut in chunks"
- "1 cup fresh blueberries"
- "1 cup heavy cream"
- " Glaze"
- "1 cup icing sugar"
- " lemon juice squeezed from 1 small lemon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200C/400F."
- "Whisk together the dry ingredients; 2 cups/260g of flour, 1 tbsp baking powder, salt, and 2 tbsp sugar. Using 2 forks or a pastry cutter, cut in the butter to coat the pieces with the flour. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Fold the blueberries into the batter. Take care not to mash or bruise the blueberries. Make a hole in the center and pour in the heavy cream (reserve 2 tbsp for brushing). Fold everything together just to incorporate; do not overwork the dough."
- "Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface into a log and flatten it to form a long rectangle. Cut the rectangle into squares, then cut the squares in half on a diagonal to get the triangle shape. Alternatively, form a ball from the dough, then flatten it and cut like a pizza to get 8-10 triangles."
- "Place the scones on a baking sheet and brush the tops with the reserved heavy cream. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until they start to turn golden. Let the scones cool a bit before you apply the glaze."
- "To prepare the glaze measure the icing sugar into a small bowl. Whisk in just enough lemon juice to make a thick glaze that drizzles (add the lemon juice gradually until you reach a liquid but thick mixture). Drizzle the glaze back and forth over the cake. The glaze will need at least 10 minutes to set."
