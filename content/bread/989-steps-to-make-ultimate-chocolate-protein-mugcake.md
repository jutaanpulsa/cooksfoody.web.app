recipeingredient:
- "1 scoop chocolate dietprotein whey I used PHD Belguim Choc"
- "1 medium egg"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "50-70 ml unsweetened almond milk or alternative"
- "5-6 drops toffee flav drops optional"
- "1 tsp good quality cocoa powder"
- " Toppings"
- " Chocolate sugar free syrup"
- "1 tbsp protein chocolate spread I used white by Myprotein"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a mug add the protein powder, and then stir in the baking powder and cocoa powder. Next add the flav drops if using them."
- "Add the egg and half the milk and give it a really good stir until it forms a thick cake batter. Add the remaining milk bit by bit whilst stirring until you get a pretty thick but smooth consistency. Ensure you really get all the bits of powder incorporated, particularly in the bottom edges of the mug."
- "Clean the edges of the inner rim of the mug using your finger, this ensures the cake rises more evenly."
- "Microwave on high for just over a minute until it has risen about 1 inch over the mugs edge. It&#39;s key that you don&#39;t over microwave it, as otherwise the texture won&#39;t be soft in the centre but firm."
- "Remove and squirt over some chocolate syrup and then add a dollop of protein chocolate spread. Eat immediately and enjoy!"
