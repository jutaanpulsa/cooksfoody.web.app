- "1 tsp Black pepper corns"

- "1 tbsp thick tamarind paste"
- "as per taste Salt"
- "As needed Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "For Masala : Dry roast the byadagi, round chillies, pepper corns and coriander seeds in a pan. Allow it to cool and podwer it in a mixer jar. Add some water and blend it into a fine thick paste and keep it aside. Blend the tomatoes separately in a mixer jar to make a puree and set it aside."
- "Keep a dry clay pot on medium flame and add 2 tbsp of oil. Add fenugreek seeds and when it is about to crackle add half of the crushed garlic and saute well. Add the chopped ginger followed by green chillies and saute till the raw smell is gone. Now add the chopped onions and stir till the onion colour changes to golden brown. Do not char the onions. At this stage add the tomato puree and give a good stir."
- "When it comes to boil lower the flame and cook for 2 mins. Now add 1 tbsp of thick tamarind paste. Add around 4 to 5 tbsp of dry roasted chilli paste and mix well. Excess chilli paste can be stored in the refrigerator for future use."
- "Add a pinch of turmeric powder. Next add salt as desired. At this stage taste the gravy. If you want it to be more tangy &amp; spicy add more tamrind paste and chilli paste. Add water as required to get the right consistency. Pulimunchi tastes good when the gravy is thick. Bring it to a good boil in a high flame. Add in the cleaned fish pieces evenly."
- "From here onwards do not stir with ladle. Instead, slowly mix the contents by holding the edges of the clay pot with a kitchen towel to avoid disintegrating the soft fish. Allow it to boil and then lower the flame to medium and cook for 3 to 4 mins. Stir the pot from the sides occasionally for even cooking. Before you could off the flame crush half of the remaining garlic clove in 3 drops of cocnut oil and pour it over the curry. Close the lid immediately &amp; switch off the flame."
- "Spicy, tangy and tasty bhoothayi pulimunchi is ready to be relished with rice, dosa and chapathi."
