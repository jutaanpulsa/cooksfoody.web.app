- "2 1/2 tbsp  Powdered sugar"
- "1/4 cup  Grated coconut"
- "1/4 cup Margarine"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium bowl, mix all the * ingredients together. Gradually add margarine in and mix them all well. As the batter gets crumbly, knead and roll it into a long stick then wrap it with the cling wrap and leave the dough for about 10-15 minutes."
- "Unwrap the dough and cut into your preferred bite size. It would be nice if you cut it using the cookie cutter. I don&#39;t have one, so after cutting it using the normal knife, I had to roll the small piece once again so that it has a better looking cookie shape."
