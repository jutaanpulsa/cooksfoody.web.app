They&#39;ll immediately begin to absorb your mayo/milk/spice mixture."
- "Gently incorporate your eggs and vegetables in with your potatoes. Again, fold in gently until everything is completely coated. If your mixture is too thick and not coating easily, just add a splash of whole milk and mix in your bowl. Repeat if necessary."
