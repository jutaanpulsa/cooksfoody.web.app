recipeingredient:
- " For the dough"
- "150 g Active sourdough starter"
- "250 g Good quality white flour"
- "125 ml Water"
- " Big pinch of salt"
- " For the topping"
- " Akkawi cheese"
- "1 tbs nigella seeds"
- " Equipment"
- " Pizza stone"
recipeinstructions:
- "Grate the Akkawi cheese into a bowl and cover with water. This will draw out some of the salt."
- "Gather your dough ingredients."
- "Make a well in the flour. Add the sourdough starter and incorporate."
- "Incorporate the water bit by bit until you have a rough dough."
- "Put some tunes on and set a timer for 15 minutes. The dough will be sticky at first but with time it will come away from the table. A great opportunity for some mindfulness - Be in the moment."
- "After 15 minutes the dough should be smooth and soft. It should not stick to the back of your hand, if it does incorporate a little more flour. Put in a lightly floured bowl, cover and rest for a minimum of 10 minutes but ideally 30. Put your oven up to max and have a pizza stone in."
- "Divide the dough into 3 even balls and shape out with your hands or a rolling pin. Make sure you have some flour down so they don’t stick."
- "Take a pice of prepared dough and put on the pizza stone in the oven for 1 minute. Repeat for the others. This will Pre-Bake the base. I find this A) makes you life easier once toppings are added I.e it does not stick to the table and B) Gives you a crispier base"
- "Sprinkle with the cheese and some nigella seeds (These bad boys add a wonderful flavour)"
- "Bake for 10 minutes each and enjoy!"
