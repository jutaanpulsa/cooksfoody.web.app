Peanut butter gives these brownies a flavor and protein boost — one reason we love to pack them in lunches. But they never lose the rich chocolatey flavor that makes brownies the best bar around. I chopped up miniature peanut butter cups to fold into the batter. I prefer a fairly small cut—not microscopic, but not gigantic chunks either that As for my friend and me, we may skip the Ghirardelli sundaes on our next SF trip if I pack a batch of these Fudgy Double Peanut Butter Brownies for us.
