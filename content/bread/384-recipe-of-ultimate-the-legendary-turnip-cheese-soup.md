recipeinstructions:
- "Add the 1/4 cup butter to the pan on medium heat, and as the butter melts whisk in the flour. Let it cook for 3-4 minutes until the flour turns a light brown and smells a little nutty."
- "In a slow, constant stream to avoid clumping, add the warm half &amp; half into the flour mixture, whisking constantly. Let the mixture heat as you whisk, and it will gradually thicken. Add the nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper."
- "Once the sauce is the consistency of a light gravy, add the grated cheese and whisk it into the sauce so it melts evenly. Set aside."

- "CAREFULLY whisk the stock mixture into the cheese sauce until it is fully incorporated. Then add the turnips."
- "Now here&#39;s the fun part! Plug in your immersion blender, and start demolishing the turnips in the soup. They don&#39;t have to be completely pureed, just enough to have small chunks of turnips in the mix. Keep the soup on a low burner until your guests arrive."
- "Top with crumbled bacon if you wish."
