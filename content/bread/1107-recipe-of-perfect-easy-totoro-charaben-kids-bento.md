recipeingredient:
- "1 serving cooked white rice to fill 12 the bento box"
- "1 sheet Nori seaweed for onigiri"
- "1 slice cheese"
- " Precut shredded nori seaweed"
- "1 Edamame"
- "2 to 3 Meatballs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pack half the bento box with rice. If the box has a divider, use it. Keep the rice covered with plastic wrap while you work to prevent it from drying out. Put the meatballs in too."
- "Cut the nori seaweed about 1cm bigger than the rice all around. The reason why it should be cut so large is because the nori shrinks a lot."
- "Cut the top part into an arch shape."
- "Take the plastic wrap off and cover the rice with the cut nori sheet. It should shrink before your eyes. Cover with the plastic wrap again. If you&#39;re not going to finish the bento right away, put it in the refrigerator."
- "Make the parts. Cut 2 pieces out of the sliced cheese using the Kyarappa cutter as shown."
- "If you slice off the end and put them together, it will become Totoro&#39;s mouth. Make it very wide."
- "Cut out Totoro&#39;s eyes using the Kyarappa cutter as shown in the photo. Cut the two circles apart where they are connected."
- "Cut out two small circles to make the Soot Sprites&#39; eyes."
- "Take the bento out of the refrigerator, and put the cut out parts on top. Tip: Place the eyes wide apart. Make the face long sideways! Don&#39;t use a long thin bento box."
- "Punch out two sets of face parts using a nori punch. Use the eyebrow parts on Totoro&#39;s chest, and the cheek parts as the Soot Sprite&#39;s eyes. Use tweezers to place the parts."
- "Here is how it looks with the nori parts in place. I used a regular paper punch from an office supply store for Totoro&#39;s eyes. I washed it well and use it for kitchen use only."
- "Use pre-cut fine shredded nori seaweed to portray the teeth. Don&#39;t worry about the top and bottom ends sticking out."
- "You can just cut off the ends later like this."
- "Stick on 5 strips for the teeth, then add the ears and nose. To make the nose, cut an edamame in half and stick it on with mayonnaise."
- "Cut the decorative dividers into ear shaped pieces, and fold them outwards. You can use old fashioned bamboo dividers, or any type you have."
- "Finished!"
