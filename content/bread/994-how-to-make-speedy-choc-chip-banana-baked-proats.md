recipeingredient:
- "40 g oats"
- "1 heaped scoop banana diet whey I used PHD nutrition brand"
- "15 g milk choc chips for baking"
- "150 ml unsweetened almond milk you may need a bit more"
- "1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "1/2 tbsp protein chocolate spread I used Grenade brand"
- "1 tsp raw organic cacao nibs optional"
- " Equipment needed"
- "1 small cast iron skillet"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. In a bowl add the oats, diet whey and baking powder and gently mix together until well combined."
- "Begin adding almond milk bit by bit then stirring well, to ensure a nice smooth semi-thick consistency. I find it&#39;s best to almost beat the mixture to get more air into it, so you get a fluffier end result."
- "Add in the Choc chips. Gently fold them into the mixture. Pour the mixture out into the skillet and using the back of a metal spoon, even it out and push it up to all edges neatly."
- "Bake in the oven for around 15 minutes or until the top has formed a nice crust and it&#39;s still slightly springy to the touch. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for a couple of minutes. Melt the chocolate protein spread by blitzing it in the microwave for a few seconds in a small dish then using a spoon drizzle it over the baked oats. If you don&#39;t have a microwave simply dollop it on top and allow to melt. Garnish with some cacoa nibs. Eat and enjoy. :)"
