- "Just before eggs are done, add frozen peas. Keep it all moving."
- "At this point a little extra oil, or butter will give it some extra flavor and moisten the rice, if you desire. 1-2 Tbl. is good. Or leave it as is. I left this one as is, but my wife said it needed some butter."
- "Add rice (2 cups seems about right)"
- "Stir until rice is mixed in and heated through. I like to turn the heat down to medium at this point, takes a couple extra minutes, but seems to limit scorching of bits here and there."
- "Add your shrimp, pepper and garlic back in"
- "Stir for about 3 minutes, until it is mixed well, and all is heated through. I also put another grind of black pepper in."
- "Serve. You can garnish with chopped green onion, cilantro or parsley (I was out, but like green onions)"
