recipeingredient:
- "1 tsp Dry yeast"
- "200 ml Teff flour"
- "200 ml White flour"
- "1/4 tsp Baking powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine all of the ingredients in a container and add water until the consistency of the batter is somewhere between that of pancakes and crepes, then whisk together until there are no more lumps."
- "Cover the top of the container with cloth, then secure with a rubber band and let sit at room temperature. For the next 1-3 days, watch for signs of fermentation."
- "Remove the cloth. If you can see small bubbles rising to the top, the batter is ready to use."
- "The consistency of the batter should be somewhere between that of pancakes and crepes. Use a non-stick frying pan and pour in the batter."
- "Cover with a lid as soon as you pour the batter in the frying pan. Wait about 30 seconds, and steam will start to rise."
- "Without flipping them like pancakes, wait for the raw white batter on top to cook, and the edges of the pancake to curl, then use a spatula and your hand to lift it off the pan."
- "You only need to cook one side. If you make a lot and stack them up, they will become moist. I store mine in a plastic bag until they&#39;re ready to serve."
- "Serve them with a variety of curries or salads as topping. The photo shows the injera cooked at the standard size."
