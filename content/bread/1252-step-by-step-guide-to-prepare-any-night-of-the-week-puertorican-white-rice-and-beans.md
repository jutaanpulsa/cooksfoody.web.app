Im puertorican and we never make rice with pigeon peas and beans, it just doesn&#39;t go together. We make white rice and beans, or any. (in Puerto Rico, it is traditional to serve rice and beans with almost every meal, but mainly with pork chops (cooked with a little sofrito and adobo seasoning) on the side). Enjoy (a wonderful recipe straight from the island). This is my quick version of Puerto Rican style beans, which I make with either pink or red canned beans and diced potatoes, perfect when you need a quick side.
