recipeingredient:
- "6 to 7 Chicken tenders"
- "2 tbsp Umeboshi paste"
- "10 Shiso leaves"
- "10 Spring roll wrappers"
- "200 ml Frying oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the chicken tenders on a heat-resistant plate, top with Japanese leek, ginger, salt, and pepper, then sprinkle on sake, wrap in plastic wrap, then microwave. See Helpful Hints."
- "Microwave for 2 minutes, turn over the tenders, then microwave for 1 more minute. Without removing the plastic wrap, allow the chicken to cook through with the residual heat. Once cool to the touch, shred each piece into 4 to 6 pieces."
- "Remove the seed from the umeboshi, then mince until it turns into a paste. (Or, you could use the tubed type from the store.)"
- "Spread out the spring roll wrapper, place a shiso leaf on top, spread on the umeboshi paste from Step 3, then top with the shredded chicken tenders."
- "As shown in the photo in Step 4, fold up the corner facing you, then fold the right and left sides over the top, and roll the rest toward the remaining corner. To seal, put a dab of katakuriko dissolved in water (not listed) on the corner (there should be instructions on how to wrap the rolls on the packaging)."
- "Fill a frying pan up to about 2 cm with oil (not listed), then deep fry the spring rolls until golden brown over medium-strong heat. Since the chicken tenders are precooked, the rolls are ready as soon as the wrapper becomes crisp."
- "Refer to the following recipe for preparing the steamed chicken tenders: All-Purpose Recipe! Chicken Tenders Steamed in the Microwave:.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/148005-all-purpose-chicken-tenders-steamed-in-the-microwave"
- "I got a lot of feedback from others saying they added cheese! Enjoy these either way--as a light-tasting or a rich-tasting dish."
