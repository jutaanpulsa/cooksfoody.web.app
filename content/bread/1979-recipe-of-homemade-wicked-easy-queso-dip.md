recipeingredient:
- "1 (24 oz.) jar chunky salsa or equal amount of homemade salsa"
- "1 packet velveeta cheese sauce or more theres 3 in a box"
- "2 (8 oz.) packages cream cheese softened"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a large mixing bowl, with a mixer, beat the cheese sauce and cream cheese together until smooth."
- "Dump in your salsa and use the mixer to blend it in well, occasionally using a rubber spatula to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl....don&#39;t wanna miss blending in any of the cheesy goodness or the salsa!"
- "Pour into a plastic container you can heat up later if you wish, or pour it into a small crockpot on low to allow it to warm up if you like....................................I personally eat this stuff right out of the fridge. Don&#39;t worry too much about it spoiling in the fridge...it rarely lasts long enough to go bad lol but even so, the ingredients in the salsa gives it a pretty decent life span. I&#39;ve never had a batch to spoil yet, but that&#39;s because it gets devoured so quickly!"
