recipeingredient:
- " All purpose flour"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- " I cup of vegetable oil"
- "1 cup warm water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the salt to the flour. Add 2 TBS of oil then slowly add the warm water and knead until you have a lovely soft dough. The more you knead the more you soft chapatis you will have."
- "Once its kneaded, divide the dough into 2 balls. Then roll each ball out, get it as round as you can. Then apply a half TBS of oil all over it."
- "Use a knife to divide the rolled out circles in half&#39;s. Then take the first half and stretch it a bit. Be gentle, make sure it doesn&#39;t tear. It should be slightly longer. The longer you can get the more layers of chapatis you will have. Get it to about 1 and half its original length."
- "Now start rolling the stretched out piece from one end to the other. You can tuck that little end bit in for a neater roll"
- "Stand the roll on your board and sort of tuck it into itself by pushing it gently and slowly down. Use your finger to do it and push it all the way down neatly. Then repeat the whole process with the second half of the circle and to the second dough."
- "So we have balls of rolled oiled stretched and squished dough from our recipe. Now set these aside, keep them covered and let them rest for about 15-30 mins to help them get super soft."
- "30 mins later, the roll are ready for the next step. They are now soft to handle."
- "Now one by one, roll out each ball into a circle. Make sure you place the rolled out chapatis on some lightly floured surface whilst you roll the rest so they don&#39;t stick."
- "When all the your chapatis are rolled out, heat the flat pan. When its hot, gently place one chapati on it and sort of dry cook it on both sides without adding any oil, for about one minute on either side. Do this with all the chapatis, setting them aside once you are done. They should be sort of half cooked."
- "When all are done, replace each one on the hot flat pan and add a bit of oil underneath them and a touch of oil on their tops. Rub it on using the back of a spoon even, then Cook them on both sides on medium heat until they are a lovely colour on either sides."
- "Turn them over a couple of times to make sure they are getting evenly coloured and not getting burnt."
- "When all are done, pile them one on top of the other, bring the sides together like you are bunching them up and thump them down a couple of times."
- "Serve while hot or warm with a stew or soup."
