- "1 large oven bag"
recipeinstructions:
- "I never really measure so I&#39;m just guessing about how much I use. The seasoning seems like a lot, but it&#39;s meant for a nice sized penir. You may add or take away to your taste."
- "Clean the penir of excess blood and rinse the skin off really good. Trim as much fat as possible."
- "Stab 1 inch holes all over the penir as deep as you can go. Set penir aside"
- "in a bowl combine Sofrito, vinegar, adobo, garlic powder, and sazon."
- "with your hands rub the marinade into the pork, filling up the holes with it. Make sure the penir is evenly seasoned."
- "fill holes with 1 garlic clove per hole and marinate overnight"
- "follow directions for the oven bag and place penir in oven bag. Pour in any marinade that has dripped from the penir"
- "allow at least 4 hours of cooking time at 350°F"
- "when you see that the penir is pretty much done open oven bag at the top exposing the skin and cook until the skin is crunchy, you may also remove the skin at this point and fry it for faster results. I personally like it from the oven."
- "note: when you buy the penir, look for the one with the least fat"
