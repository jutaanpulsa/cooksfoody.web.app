- "3 large eggs at room temperature"
- " Chocolate topping"
- "1/2 cup 1 stick 115g unsalted butter"
- "1 heaping cup around 200g semisweet chocolate chips"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line the bottom and sides of a 9×13 inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished bars out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside."
- "For the Crust: In a food processor or blender, pulse the whole sandwich cookie into a fine crumb. Stir the cookie crumbs and melted butter together in a large bowl. Press tightly into the bottom of the lined baking pan. Pre-bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside. Leave oven on."
- "For the cheesecake filling: Using a handheld mixer beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the sour cream and beat until fully combined. Then add the peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt and beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the 3rd egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing."
- "Pour the cheesecake filling onto the crust. Spread evenly on top with a rubber spatula or back of a spoon. Bake for 35-38 minutes or until the cheesecake appears set on top and the edges are browned. The edges may slightly crack. (Mine do!) The bars will be puffy, but will sink slightly down as they cool. Place pan on a wire rack. Cool for 1 hour at room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 3-4 hours."
- "For the chocolate topping: Cut the butter into Tablespoon size pieces. Place into a heat-proof bowl. Pour chocolate chips on top and melt over a pot of boiling water. Once melted and combined, pour over the cheesecake and refrigerate for 1 hour before cutting into squares."
