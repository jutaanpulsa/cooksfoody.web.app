recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the ☆ ingredients in a bowl with a whisk. Then mix in the vinegar and pour the batter into some muffin cups."
- "I&#39;m using 7 silicon muffin cups that are 1.5 cm deep."
- "Fill a 24 cm diameter frying pan with 0.7-1 cm water and place the muffin cups inside. Then cover the pan with a lid and steam the bread over medium-high heat."
- "When the water starts boiling, turn the heat to low and steam the bread for a further 6-7 minutes. Test the bread to see if it&#39;s done by inserting a skewer or toothpick in the center. If no raw batter gets stuck to it, it&#39;s ready."
- "You can still make this steamed bread in about 10 minutes even when using larger cups."
- "※ This steamed bread is nice and fluffy because sodium bicarbonate in the baking powder reacts with the acetic acid in the vinegar to make carbon dioxide gas."
- "It also produces carbonic acid which then splits into gas and water."
- "Variation: You can replace the sugar with brown sugar and add some walnuts to make some traditional gantsuki."
