- "2 cup Long grain Rice uncooked"
- "1 can 135 oz coconut milk I use Goya"
- "1 can 15 oz Green Pigeon Peas I use Goya"
- "2 tbsp coconut flakes"

recipeinstructions:
- "Wash &amp; clean the rice until the water runs clear then set aside."
- "Rinse the pigeon peas. Set aside. You don&#39;t have to buy the canned ones. If using bagged ones you would have to cook them first."
- "In a stock pot or cauldron (I have an old one that has lasted me many many yrs and I only cook rice in it) Heat your oil on low. Put in your coconut flakes. You want the oil to be infused with the coconut flavor. Do this about 3 to 5 minutes without browning the flakes too much."
- "Add the coconut milk, stir. Then add the pigeon peas &amp; rice."
- "Add the water. I use 1/2 the can the coconut milk came in for my water. A trick I was taught to know if there&#39;s enough water is to put a spoon in the middle of the pot, if the spoon falls added too much water, if the spoon stays upright you&#39;ve added enough water."
- "Add the salt &amp; stir pot."
- "Turn the heat up to medium high. Watch the rice until all the liquid has been absorbed turn the heat to med. low and stir the rice. I take a piece of aluminum foil, make a mound in the middle of the pot with the rice and place the foil on top then cover with the lid of the pot."
- "Approx. after 15 minutes stir and do the same as previous step. Leave on low and let rice cook. If you stir it too much, your rice can get mushy. Just let rice cook, stir a couple more times when you check it to see if the rice is done."
- "After its cooked, plate it. You can put some more flakes on top if you like. You don&#39;t have to use the peas if you don&#39;t like them, make just the coconut rice."
