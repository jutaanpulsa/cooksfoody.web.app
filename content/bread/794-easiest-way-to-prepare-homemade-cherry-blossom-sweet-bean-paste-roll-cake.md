- "1 Sakura an"
- " Sponge Cake"
- "1 large Egg"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "25 grams Rice flour"
- "2 leaves  Saltpickled sakura leaves"
- "1 tsp Soy milk or cows milk"
- "1 tsp Vegetable oil"
- " Gyuuhi"
- "25 grams Shiratamako"

- "40 ml Water"
- "1 Flour or katakuriko"
recipeinstructions:
- "I used an all-purpose tray that I bought from a dollar store for this recipe."
- "Let the egg and soy milk warm to room temperature. One you have rinsed the sakura leaves, leave them to soak in fresh water for 2-3 hours to remove the saltiness. Pat the leaves dry and finely chop them."
- "Crack the egg into a bowl and whisk it with an electric mixer on high speed. Add the sugar in 3 portions and continue to whisk until the mixture is thick. Then reduce the speed and continue to whisk until smooth."
- "Add the rice flour and chopped sakura leaves into the mixture and mix them in gently with the whisk. (Do this by scooping up batter from the bottom and dropping it back into the bowl.) Switch to using a spatula and mix in the soy milk."
- "Pour the mixture into a baking tray lined with parchment paper and bake it for 5 minutes at 180°C.  Place the cake inside a large plastic bag and leave it to cool."
- "Making the gyuuhi Mix the shiratamako and sugar together in a heat-proof container. Add the water and mix further, before covering the container loosely with cling film and heating for 30 seconds in the microwave."
- "Take the mixture out of the microwave, give it a quick stir with a spatula, and then put it back in again for another 30 seconds. If it needs more time then heat it for a further 30 seconds. Once glossy, turn the mixture out onto a layer of katakuriko."
- "Dust your hands with flour and stretch the mixture out so that it is longer than the sponge. Spread the cherry blossom sweet bean paste over the sponge from Step 5 and place the roll of gyuuhi on top of the edge of the sponge that&#39;s closest to you. Then roll the sponge up in one go."
- "Place the roll cake seam-down and wrap it in cling film. Leave the roll to sit for 2-3 hours, then cut into slices, and serve."
- "Check outfor how to make homemade cherry blossom sweet bean paste. Store-bought is OK to use as well."
- "This is the old photo that I was using for this recipe."
- "The roll cake smells even more delicious when wrapped in a sakura leaf."
