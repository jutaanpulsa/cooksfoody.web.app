recipeingredient:
- "450 grams (1 lb) dark brown sugar"
- "125 mls (1/2 cup) hot water"
- "115 grams (4 oz) golden syrup or corn syrup"
- "115 grams (4 oz) dark treacle or molasses"
- "1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar"
- "as needed oil for greasing"
recipeinstructions:
- "Line the base and sides of an A4 (11 x 8&#34;) size oven tray with baking paper and then grease it really well"
- "Put the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat until the sugar dissolves. Don&#39;t stir, but tilt the pan if you need to move it around"
- "Mix all the other ingredients in a greased jug, to make it easier to pour out the treacle &amp; syrup. Add to the saucepan. Pop a sugar thermometer in, and give the mix a swirl, but stir as little as possible"
- "Bring to the boil and continue heating until it reaches the soft crack point for toffee (140°C/270°F). This may take up to 30 minutes, so be patient. Don&#39;t leave the pan unattended though, as the temperature can change quickly"
- "As soon as it reaches temperature, remove from the heat and pour in to the greased tray"
- "Add hot water to your saucepan and bring to the boil with the thermometer still in. This will make it easier to clean while the toffee cools"
- "Allow the sheet of toffee to cool and harden, then remove from the tray. Wrap in cling film, baking paper, or cover with a tea towel to prevent flying shards"
- "Place on a firm, hard, surface and break into eating-size pieces with a hammer or rolling pin. Store in cellophane bags, or an airtight tin, till November 5th 🔥🎆"
- "Now grab your toffee and celebrate the capture of Catholic terrorist Guy Fawkes in the tunnels beneath Parliament with 60 barrels of gunpowder on November 5th 1605. Fawkes had been the explosives expert in a plot by Catholic conspirators to overthrow the British Parliament and kill King James I"
- "Fawkes was hung, drawn, and quartered, and then the pieces burned on a bonfire. To this day, his effigy is traditionally burned on a bonfire, usually accompanied by a fireworks display"
