recipeingredient:
- "1 Fish sausages"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 tsp for each side Flour optional"
- "1 tsp Finely grated cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the fish sausage into 8-10 pieces, arrange them on a large plate, and sprinkle with flour."
- "Since this step is such a pain, you just need to flour one surface of the sausages. 1 teaspoon of flour should be enough for all 10 slices. Just coat them roughly like in the photo."
- "Lightly season the egg with salt and pepper. If you have some finely grated cheese, add that in as well and make a batter."
- "Dip the fish sausage in the batter. Dip it in quickly so that the flour doesn&#39;t flake off."
- "Heat up a lightly oiled frying pan and cook the sausage slices on low-medium."
- "When both sides have cooked, dip each slice in the batter again and continue cooking."
- "Keep repeating this step until the sausage has been dipped 3 times. Serve these sausage slices in your lunch box, they taste delicious with or without ketchup."
- "By the way, if you decide not to coat the sausage in flour, this is how the surface of each slice will look. The coating hasn&#39;t adhered as well as the floured versions but these are just the backs so no one is going to see."
