recipeinstructions:

- "Once cheese has melted, add nutmeg and white pepper. Stir the cheese mixture. In a small bowl add corn flour and water (this thickens the cheese mixture). Add a dash of Cherry Kirsch (optional, I didn&#39;t add this as I don&#39;t like the taste). Let the cheese fondue cook for a few minutes until it begins to thicken. Turn down the heat to medium low."
- "In the meantime place a few slices of the Continental meat selection onto a chopping board and place a few pieces of cornichons on a side plate."
- "Slice the bread into thick chunks, (bread can be heated up slightly in oven, optional) and transfer to a large plate. Remove the steamed vegetables from the steamer and transfer to a plate. Lastly, transfer the cheese fondue mixture from the pot into a fondue pot. Place over a stand and burner."
- "Enjoy cheese fondue with bread dipped into the melted cheese, along with the steamed vegetables, cut meats and cornichons!"
