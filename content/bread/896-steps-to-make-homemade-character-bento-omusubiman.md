- "1/2 bowl Plain cooked rice"
- "1 whatever you like Rice ball filling"

- "1 Carrot"
- "1 Fish sausage"
- "1 Cheese"
- "1 Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut out 4 triangles, 2 eyebrows, 2 eyes and a mouth from the nori seaweed. If you fold the nori seaweed in half and then cut out the triangles, eyebrows and eyes then everything will be nice and symmetrical. Use a small pair of scissors."
- "After cutting off a thin round slice of carrot, boil it and then use a circular cutter to cut out a nose. You can make the shine on the nose from a slice of cheese."
- "Thinly slice the fish sausage and cut out 2 cheeks with a straw. (You can also use the carrot to create some cheeks if you wish.)"
- "Make the onigiri rice ball. Once it&#39;s cooled, stick on all of the parts except for the cheese and wrap tightly in cling film to help secure everything together."
- "Unwrap the cling film and add the rice ball to a bento box. Lastly, add the cheese on top of the nose to finish!!"
- "You can use the same ingredients (minus 2 triangles) to make Komusubiman (Riceballman Jr.) as well if you round the rice ball off a bit more."
- "I made these by replacing the noses with a slice of sausage and a dollop of mayonnaise and the cheeks with ketchup Feel free to substitute some parts with whatever ingredients you have lying around!"
