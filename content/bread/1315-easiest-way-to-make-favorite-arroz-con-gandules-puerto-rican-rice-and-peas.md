- "2 envelope goya pork boullion"

recipeinstructions:
- "Please measure your rice to water according to directions on rice bag. I never measure, I just go by what I see. Usually my water is about 1/2 inch above the rice in the pot"
- "In a medium sized aluminum rice pot, heat oil and sofrito on medium high heat until oil turns green, stirring constantly"
- "Add adobo, garlic powder, sazon, pork flavor, tomato sauce, water and pigeon peas and bring to a boil"
- "Wash rice and add to pot stirring occasionally (so that the rice doesn&#39;t stick)"

- "Rice is done when rice grains are open."
- "Note: you can also use corn, Vienna sausages, red beans, chorizo, chicken, cut ham or just plain yellow rice instead of using gandules. This is the typical recipe for Puerto Rican rice. I also add pimiento sometimes."
