recipeingredient:
- "7 large Egg yolks"
- "80 grams or so Sugar"
- "6 tbsp Vegetable oil"
- "5 tbsp Milk"
- "1/2 tsp or so Pandan essence"
- "140 grams Cake flour"
- "1 tsp Baking powder"
- "7 large Egg whites"
- "80 grams Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Lemon juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the egg whites and yolks, and refrigerate the whites. Beat the yolks with a whisk or handheld mixer. Add the sugar to it in 2 to 3 batches, mixing it in well each time until the combination becomes pale."
- "Add the vegetable oil and then the milk a little at a time while mixing well. Put the pandan essence in a little at a time, until the batter has a rather strong green color. (If you don&#39;t have any, add two teaspoons of coconut essence, and drop in some green food coloring a little bit at a time.)"
- "Sift the cake flour and baking powder together while adding it to the batter in one go. Mix well with a whisk. Make sure that the batter is evenly mixed. It&#39;s okay to over-mix it a little. Preheat the oven to 180°C."
- "Make the meringue: Add the lemon juice to the ＊ egg whites, and start mixing with a handheld mixer, set at a low speed to start with. Switch it up to high speed, and keep beating the egg whites while adding the sugar in 2 to 3 batches, turning the beaters around the bowl. When the foam is quite sturdy, lower the speed again to firm up the texture of the meringue. You&#39;ll have a fine, glossy meringue. Don&#39;t over-beat the meringue! It should just form soft peaks that flop down."
- "Put 2 scoops of the meringue in the bowl with the batter, and cut and fold it in using a spatula. When that meringue is well mixed in, add the batter to the bowl with the remaining meringue. Scoop the mixture up from the bottom, and cut and fold the batter together while trying not to crush all the air out. Be sure to not leave any white streaks."
- "When the batter is well mixed, put it into the cake tin. Go around the perimeter of the cake tin 2 to 3 times, then start baking. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes at 170 to 180°C, and its done!! I usually bake it at 175°C for 45 minutes. If a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean, the cake is done."
- "Turn the cake tin upside down as soon as you take it out of the oven, and leave it alone until it has cooled down completely. Take it carefully out of the tin, slice and dive in."
- "This is pandan essence! I bought it at an Asian grocery store. By the way, I tried licking it straight and tasted awful. Local people say that cake made with pandan is different, but to me one made with coconut essence and food coloring tastes almost the same, and I couldn&#39;t tell the difference."
