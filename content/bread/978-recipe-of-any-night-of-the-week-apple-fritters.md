recipeingredient:
- " Batter"
- "1/4 C. Whey Protein"
- "1/4 C. Coconut Flour"
- "1/4 C. egg whites"
- "1 tsp. baking powder"
- "1 1/2 TBS Greek plain yogurt or buttermilk or sour cream"

- "2 tsp. soft butter"
- " Oil for cooking your preference"
- " Coating"
- "1/2 C. erythritol"
- "1/2-3/4 tsp. cinnamon"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oil on medium low to low. Heat in a deep pot/sauce pan or fry pan."
- "Meanwhile, mix the ingredients together, including the butter**. (The butter is a recent update--I discovered it adds more flavor and moisture.)"
- "If the batter seems too runny, add coconut flour in 1 teaspoon increments--allow batter to rest for about 5 minutes before adding anymore coconut flour, if needed."
- "Test the oil by dropping a tiny amount of batter in the oil--it&#39;s ready when the batter sizzles and starts to turn brown."
- "Scoop a heaping tablespoon of the batter into your hands then flatten it between the palms of your hands."
- "Slowly drop into the hot oil.  Fry one at a time for approx. 30 seconds to1 minute per side, or until each side is a golden brown.  Keep a close watch on these!  They brown quicker than you can blink your eyes!  (Note: if the first one gets too dark too fast, turn the heat down a little and allow the oil to reduce in temp. before frying anymore.)"
- "Remove from the oil with tongs or a slotted spoon, drain on paper towels, then rest in the coating mixture and spoon coating over entire fritter.  (Be careful! These will be HOT!)"
- "Allow to cool on a plate covered with paper towels."
