recipeinstructions:
- "In my home, the kids don&#39;t eat the crusts of their bread in the morning. So I store them in the freezer."
- "Once there is a good amount stored up... I receive the order to make snack using the bread crusts!"
- "Line the microwave&#39;s turntable with parchment paper and place the crusts on top, making sure they don&#39;t overlap."
- "Microwave them until they are hard to the touch. If using the amount shown in the photo, microwave for about 3-4 minutes at 500 W. They&#39;ll burn if you cook them too much, so be careful..."
- "Place the kinako and sugar into a plastic bag (use as much or as little as you want). Add the bread crusts and shake it up."
- "Since the crusts aren&#39;t fried, the sugar doesn&#39;t stick too well on their own.... but the kinako coats the crusts easily."
