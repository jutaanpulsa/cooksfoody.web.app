recipeinstructions:
- "Try if u can, To remove the bone or have it removed . To get the full flavor in and out.  Then stab holes all over it.Take all but the minced garlic and add wet ingredients. All over meat and in any of the wholes shove the minced garlic. Add all the dry ingredients massage all spices very well. Taste the spices (not the pork) to confirm it&#39;s not too much of anything u don&#39;t like. U can now wait from an hr to 3 days of marinating. Leave in the freezer nice and sealed till u r ready ."
- "Put in a deep dish pot roast pan. I prefer metal the foil cooks faster n can turn out tough n dry if left too long. Depending on the size like,smaller than a turkey I look at it and can estimate how many will it feed. I dont go by weight. It will shrink once all the fat cooks out n melts. So with that being said, almost always it&#39;s 350&#39; degrees for 3 or 4 hrs. Always after the first 2hrs it should smell delicious n be tender but not ready unless u bought a tiny one. REMEMBER TO KEEP IT JUICY FAT SIDE UP ALWAYS. If u want the fat to be a lil crunchy leave open and raise the temp the last 15 min. To 375/400 remember temperature varies in different ovens, Moniter."
- "Wen its done add xtra lemon before serving. U can have it with ANYTHING. Juicy is main recipe."
